Preliminary Study of the Nuclear Subterrene\1971\The rock-melting drill was invented at Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory in 1960. Electrically heated, laboratory-scale drills were subsequently shown to penetrate igneous rocks at usefully high rates, with moderate power consumptions. The development of compact nuclear reactors and of heat pipes now makes possible the extension of this technology to much larger melting penetrators, potentially capable of producing holes up to several meters in diameter and several tens of kilometers long or deep. Development of a rapid, versatile, economical method of boring large, long shafts and tunnels offers solutions to many of mans most urgent ecological, scientific, raw-materials, and energy-supply problems. A melting method appears to be the most promising and flexible means of producing such holes. It is relatively insensitive to the composition, hardness, structure, and temperature of the rock, and offers the possibilities of producing self-supporting, glass-lined holes in almost any formation and (using a technique called lithofracturing) of eliminating the debris-removal problem by forcing molten rock into cracks created in the bore wall. Large rock-melting penetrators, called Electric Subterrenes or Nuclear Subterrenes according to the energy source used, are discussed in this report, together with problems anticipated in their development. It is concluded that this development is within the grasp of present technology. 
Geology of the Jemez Plateau, west of Valles Caldera\1973\The Jemez Plateau at the site proposed for a geothermal-energy study forms an apron around the west side of the Valles Caldera. Five test holes were drilled on the plateau for geologic information, temperature data, and to investigate drilling problems. Four of the test holes, ranging in depth from 500 to 750 ft, penetrated volcanic rocks of Cenozoic Age and were completed into the sediments of Permian Age. A deep test hole, drilled 2575 ft, penetrated the volcanic rocks of Cenozoic Age and sediments of Permian and Pennsylvanian Age, and is completed into the rocks of Precambrian Age. The basic part of the study is to be made in the Precambrian rocks. Test drilling and measured sections indicate a small north-south trending basin near the center plateau in which the sediments thicken. The basin may be structural in part or erosional where the upper surface of Precambrian rocks was cut to form a small valley before deposition of the sediments. The geologic logs of the five test holes are included. 
Statement by Morton C. Smith, Project Manager, Geothermal Energy, Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory, the University of California, Representing the United States Atomic Energy Commission, before the Subcommittee on Water and Power Resources, Committee on Interior and Insular Affairs, United States Senate, Hearing on the Potential for the Production of Power from Geothermal Resources\1973\"Mr. Chairman, Members of the Subcommittee on Water and Power Resources: I am honored to have been asked by the Atomic Energy Commission to discuss with you that part of our nation's geothermal resource which exists simply as heat in the earth's crust. It is the largest reservoir of directly usable energy that is accessible to man; it is inherently clean energy; and I am deeply involved in the challenging job of learning how to make it useful. For brevity, most of us identify this as the ""'hot dry rock"" type of geothermal energy. Actually, much of the hot rock that is within our reach is not complete.ly dry. For any of several geologic reasons, however, it does not usually have the combination of a large water content, connected circulation channels, and impermeable barriers above and around it, that together produce a useful natural reservoir of steam or hot water. As a result, we cannot in general simply drill a hole into hot rock and expect nature to bring the heat up to us in the convenient form of steam or hot water. If we are ever to use a significant fraction of this very large resource, we must develop it more aggressively, and actually create the circulation systems within it that nature has failed to provide. We are now quite sure that man-made geothermal systems are possible; that we have both the ideas and the tools to make them; and that they are very much worth making. However, to prove all this will require a considerable investment of time, effort, and money. "
Experimental measurement of in situ stress in granite by hydraulic fracturing\1974\Hydraulic-fracturing experiments were carried out in a 785-m wellbore drilled 145 m into Precambrian granite. The energy required to create and then to reopen one fracture was determined by integrating the pressure-volume curves, a technique suitable for use in rock of low permeability or with nonpenetrating fluids. A value of 100 J/m was obtained for the apparent surface energy of the granite, in situ. Two values of 14.7 MPa and one of 13.7 MPa were obtained for the least principal earth stress by independent methods. In a later experiment, a large volume (4000 liter) fracture was formed under pressure sufficient to raise the overburden. The pressure history of this fracture after shut-in indicates that an almost horizontal fracture was opened, as well as a vertical one. 
Geology of geothermal test hole GT-2 Fenton Hill Site, July 1974\1974\The test hole GT-2, drilled at the Fenton Hill Site, was completed at a depth of 6346 ft (1934.3 m) below land surface. The hole penetrated 450 ft (137.2 m) of Cenozoic volcanics, 1945 ft (592.8 m) of sediments of Permian and Pennsylvanian age and 3951 ft (1204.3 m) of granitic rocks of Precambrian age. This report presents the field geologic log of the hole and hydrologic data compiled during the drilling phase of the program. 
Instrumentation for granite test No. 1\1974\From 20th international instrumentation symposium; Albuquerque, New Mexico, USA (21 May 1974). Initial measurements to evaluate the feasibility of extracting energy from hot-dry rock in Precambrian basement (granite) employing hydraulic-fracturing techniques were explored in the LASL Granite Test Hole No. 1. Following a series of hydrology experiments in the 785-m (2575 ft) depth hole, preparations were made to instrument a series of hole-pressurization and hydraulicfracturing experiments. The instrumentation was designed to measure breakdown pressure, crack-extension pressure, and shut-in pressure for each fracture and to determine principle tectonic stresses, breakdown stress for hydraulic fracturing, and leak-off rate for fracturing fluid.

Proceedings of the NATO-CCMS information meeting on dry hot rock geothermal energy, September 17--19, 1974, Los Alamos, New Mexico\1974\A summary of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) Committee on Challenges of Modern Society (CCMS) Information Meeting on Dry Hot Rock Geothermal Energy is presented. Contributions from �participating-countries are included with any pertinent discussion that followed each presentation. The geothermal efforts of the United States in the area of dry hot rock energy extraction are covered in detail, with particular emphasis on the Atomic Energy Commission's ~program at Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory and the National Science Foundation's program at Marysville, Montana. 
Fault activity and seismicity near the Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory geothermal test site, Jemez Mountains, New Mexico\1975\The purpose of this study is to develop guidelines for evaluating geothermal sites for earthquake hazards and for the possibility of siting on an active fault. These guidelines were used to minimize these risks for a specific geothermal test site of the Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory (I.ASL) on the Jemez Plateau, a few miles west of the Valles Caldera, at the center of the Jemez Mountains in north-central New Mexico. The approach to the problem involves new methods of low-sun-angle aerial photography and photogeology, in combination with conventional geological and seismicity studies. The possibility of future surface faulting or occurrence of strong local earthquakes is analyzed by comparing the structural and seismic setting of the area of investigation with that of the Rio Grande depression and other active zones in the western United States. The evaluation includes identification, delineation and characterization of faults in the region with conventional high-sun-angle aerial photographs, special low-sun-angle aerial photographs taken specifically for this project, Earth Resources Technology Satellite (ERTS) imagery, manned space satellite photography, search of the geological literature, and aerial and ground reconnaissance using both low and high sun angles �of illumination at midday, early morning, and late afternoon. The site area is near the western edge of the Rio Grande depression, the most active seismic zone of New Mexico. The Rio Grande depression is marked in places by geologically youthful fault scarps and in places is known to have significant normal faults. 
Geophysical logging in Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory geothermal test hole No. 2\1975\"The Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory drilled Geothermal Test Hole No. 2 to a depth of 2932 m (9619 ft) as a part of the ""Dry Hot Rock"" Geothermal Energy Project. The hole encountered 732 m (2402 ft) of volcanic and sedimentary rocks before penetrating 2200 m (7217 ft) of crystalline rock. Various geophysical logs were run, the most useful for the purposes of the project being the full-wave sonic logs, as an indication of relative competence of the rock, and the spectral gamma~ ay log, to indicate general rock type. "
Hydrologic testing Geothermal Test Hole No. 2\1975\"Analyses of drill-stem tests performed in Geothermal Test Hole No. 2 (GT-2) indicate that the jointed, but competent, rock tested can for geothermal project purposes be considered ""dry."" The intervals tested were selected by the use of geophysical logs so as to exclude occasional zones of intense fracturing. "
Planning, drilling, and logging of Geothermal Test Hole GT-2, Phase I\1975\Geothermal Test Hole No. 2 (GT-2) is a deep exploratory hole drilled into the Precambrian-age basement granitic rocks of the Jemez Mountains in north-central New Mexico. The purpose of the hole is to confirm the suitability of the Fenton Hill Site for development of the world's first dry hot rock geothermal energy experiment. Due to recent volcanic activity in the area, the near-surface rocks still retain a great amount of heat. The drilling of GT-2 was required to obtain additional information on the geology and the heat flow characteristics of the area, and to determine the problems involved in drilling and taking core samples in the granitic basement rocks and the overlying sedimentary formations. Squeezing clay layers, caving shale beds, and lost-circulation zones provided difficult drilling conditions in the upper section of the hole. It had been planned to drill the Precambrian granitic rocks with compressed air as the circulation medium, but higher than anticipated water flows at depth forced abandonment of this method in favor of a fluid circulation medium. Various diagnostic logging techniques proved to be of invaluable assistance in determining formation characteristics. This report describes the first phase of the drilling and logging operations in GT-2. 
Preliminary measurements of the thermal conductivity of rocks from LASL geothermal test holes GT-1 and GT-2\1975\The conductivities on a number of dry rocks have been measured in an air environment. These experimental values are probably about 10 percent lower than the in situ values. Initial attempts to prepare ''wet'' rock samples (rocks saturated with water) have so far resulted in only ''damp'' rocks. Considerable effort will be required to characterize the crack system in ''solid'' rocks and to predict the probable conductivity values for in situ conditions.
Temperature measurements in the Precambrian section of Geothermal Test Hole No. 2\1975\Temperature measurements have been made throughout most of the Precambrian section of Geothermal Test Hole No. 2 (GT-2), the second deep exploratory test hole in the Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory�s Dry Hot Rock Geothermal Energy Project. Successful bottomhole temperature measurements were made at nine successive depths during interruptions in drilling. A thermistor probe was used to measure temperature under conditions in which the bottom 10 m of the borehole was filled with either air, water, mud, or water-saturated silt. Several techniques were developed to insure that the thermistor sonde was positioned directly on bottom and isolated from the convecting borehole fluids. These techniques proved successful. Equilibrium rock temperatures calculated from relaxation data using a new method show, geothermal gradients of from 50 to 60�C/km in the intervals measured, the gradient generally increasing with depth. The equilibrium rock temperature is 195.80C at a depth of 2900 m (28 m above the present bottom of the borehole) based on 30 h of continuous bottomhole temperature measurements. The extrapolated equilibrium rock temperature at the GT-2 terminal depth of 2928 m is 1970C. 
Testing, drilling, and logging of Geothermal Test Hole GT-2, phase II\1975\Geothermal Test Hole No. 2 (GT-2) is a deep exploratory hole drilled the Precambrian-age granitic rocks underlying the Jemez Mountains of north-central New Mexico. The purpose of the hole is to confirm the suitability of the Fenton Hill site for development of the world�s first dry hot rock geothermal energy extraction experiment. Due to recent volcanic activity in the area, the near-surface rocks still retain a great amount of heat. The drilling of GT-2 to a depth of 1937 m (6356 ft) was completed in 1974. Following the drilling, a series of hydrology experiments was performed to determine the permeability of the granitic rock at depth. Hydraulic fracturing experiments, using methods and equipment developed by the oil-well service industry, were conducted at specific zones in the granitic section of the hole. An additional 105 m (345 ft) of drilling 0� were completed during this testing phase to allow experiments to be conducted in a �fresh� hole. Various diagnostic-logging operations were performed during testing and drilling. This report describes the second phase of the development of GT-2. 
Testing, drilling, and logging of geothermal test hole GT-2, Phase III. [Drilling depth of 2932 m]\1975\Geothermal Test Hole No. 2 (GT-2) is a deep exploratory hole drilled into the Precambrian-age basement granitic rocks of the Jemez Mountains in north-central New Mexico. The purpose of the hole is to confirm the suitability of the Fenton Hill site for development of the world�s first dry hot rock geothermal energy experiment. The drilling of GT-2 to a depth of 2042.6 m (6701.5 ft) was completed in September 1974, and represented Phase I of the Fenton Hill site evaluation. A series of hydraulic fracturing tests, conducted �at specific depths in the granitic section of the hole, was completed in early October 1974. Following this second-phase work, the hole was deepened to 2932 m (9619 ft). Various diagnostic logging operations were performed after the drilling was completed. A 185-m-long (608-ft) liner assembly terminating at its upper end in a polished-bore receptacle was then placed and cemented in the bottom section of the hole. This report describes the third phase of the development of GT-2 including deepening and logging the hole and installing and testing the liner assembly. 
Zuni Mountains, New Mexico as a potential dry hot rock geothermal energy Site\1975\Many of the criteria for the successful exploitation of energy from dry hot rock are met in the Zuni Mountains, New Mexico. This area falls within a broad region of abnormally high heat flow on the Colorado Plateau. Within this region, a variety of evidence indicates that local ''hot spots'' may be present. These ''hot spots'' are prime targets for dry hot rock exploration. A site-evaluation program utilizing geological, geochemical-geochronological, and geophysical techniques is proposed to delineate the optimal sites for subsequent exploratory drilling.
Environmental monitoring for the hot dry rock geothermal energy development project. Annual report, July 1975--June 1976\1976\The objectives of this environmental monitoring report are to provide a brief conceptual and historical summary of the Hot Dry Rock Geothermal Project, a brief overview of the environmental monitoring responsibilities and activities of the Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory, and descriptions of the studies, problems, and results obtained from the various monitoring programs. Included are descriptions of the work that has been done in three major monitoring areas: (1) water quality, both surface and subsurface; (2) seismicity, with a discussion of the monitoring strategy of regional, local, and close-in detection networks; and (3) climatology. The purpose of these programs is to record baseline data, define potential effects from the project activities, and determine and record any impacts that may occur.
Flow Results of Experiment 117\1976\Experiment 117, performed on two separate days, was primarily a seismic fracture orientation experiment. On Wednesday, March 3, the fracture intersecting EE-1 was reinflated for the first time using a Western pump -- a total of 9170 gallons was pumped into EE-1 at a constant rate of 4 bbl/min. On Friday_, March 5, the EE-1 fracture was again inflated and then extended while pumping a total of 31,140 gallons into EE-1, ~gain using a Western pump. For Friday's experiment, GT-2 was shut in during the pumping phase, and then vented over the weekend with EE-1 shut in. The pumping profile for Friday's experiment, shown in Fig. 1, included several constant flow rate plateaus during and following the seismic phase of the experiment, at flow rates varying from 1 to 5 bbl/min. It is primarily the results of these stepped-flow-rate portions of Experiment 117 that are herein discussed and analyzed. 
LASL Hot Dry Rock Geothermal Project. Progress report, July 1, 1975--June 30, 1976\1976\Successful drilling into hard crystalline rock was accomplished to depths of about 3 km. Hydraulic fractures in the crystalline rock with radii as large as 150 m were produced. Values of in situ permeability of the Fenton Hill granite were measured. Directional drilling at depths of up to 3 km was accomplished. At least 90 to 95 percent of water injected into fractured regions was recovered. A connection was established between two deep boreholes through a fractured region of hot granite for the first time. Instruments were developed to operate for several hours under the downhole conditions. The compressional and shear components of seismic signals produced by fracture extension and inflation were detected downholes. Acoustic ranging has generally identified the relative positions of two boreholes at several depths. Self-potential and induced potential techniques have determined vertical fracture lengths at the borehole. Pressure-flow and fluid residence time distribution studies have measured properties of the downhole system. Core sample studies have provided physical and chemical data. Techniques were developed to examine reservoir performance. A geothermal power-production model was formulated. (MHR)
Seismic signal location program for the Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory's dry hot rock geothermal project\1976\During hydraulic fracturing, seismic signals produced as the fracture grows may be used to determine orientation, size, and shape of the fracture. This seismic signal location program has been written to utilize such signals, along with an experimentally determined seismic velocity model to help determine the fracture orientation, size, and shape.
Analysis of Experiment 169\1977\This experiment was conducted on 6-15-77, after the cessation of drilling operations in GT-28, but before casing the hole. The major test objective was to obtain a base line system impedance. It 4s concluded that after a correction for buoyancy, amounting to 2 psi/gpm, the minimum impedance measured during the experiment was i0.5 psi/gpm. This value was obtained, rather suddenly, after the EE-1 surface pressure had attained 1280 psi. The borehole at depth of the fracture had been cooled by 100�C, however, as a result of the high pumping rate, so it is estimated that the downhole fracture pressure had effectively increased by 1536 psi which should have been sufficient to inflate, i.e., open up part of the fracture system and thus reduce its flow impedance. Interpretation of the GT-2B temperature logs indicate/ that there are two major connections in GT-2 with the upper connection at 8755 ft all depths in the text are true vertical depth measured from a datum 8700 feet above MSL) and the lower at 8860 ft. Both of these depths are approximately 13 ft deeper than those reported by Lee Aamodt based upon depressurization data observed during the core watch, but the difference may not be statistically significant. Analysis of the logs taken during Exp. 169 as well as Exp. 170 indicate that 78% of the flows via the upper connection, while 22% via the lower. Interpretation of the EE-1 logs indicate the old fracture in EE-1 is closed and that the flow goes up behind the casing exiting at 8814 and 8665 ft. 
Environmental investigations associated with the LASL hot dry rock geothermal energy development project\1977\The Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory (LASL) is currently evaluating the feasibility of extracting thermal energy from hot dry rock (HDR) geothermal reservoirs. An overview of the environmental studies that LASL has conducted relative to its HDR Geothermal Energy Development Project is presented. Because HDR geothermal technology is a new field of endeavor, environmental guidelines have not been established. It is anticipated that LASL's research will lead to the techniques necessary to mitigate undesirable environmental impacts in future HDR developments. To date, results of environmental investigations have been positive in that no undesirable environmental impacts have been found.
Exploration methods for hot dry rock. Report of the panel held June 22, 1976\1977\The geological and geophysical characteristics of hot dry rock (HDR) necessary for an effective exploration program were discussed. The type of HDR project discussed, that being developed by the Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory (LASL), would utilize hydraulic fracturing to develop a large surface area in rock of low permeability, 10/sup -6/ darcys, and at temperatures greater than 200/sup 0/C. A better definition of the thermal regime in the crust and mantle at reconnaissance (hundreds to tens of kilometers) and exploration (tens of kilometers to 1 km) scales is needed. Geophysical methods capable of deep investigation would be used with the near-surface geologic information to extrapolate conditions at the depth of interest. Detection of HDR per se may be difficult because the contrast in physical properties of HDR and other rock is not always unambiguous, but boundaries between rock environments can be delineated. When patterns and coincidence of various types of geophysical anomalies and geologic maps are used, the probability of the detection of HDR is greatly increased, especially when a consistent picture is described. Various geophysical methods are required to detect these anomalies: (a) electromagnetic techniques can map deep electrically conductive structures, which to some extent can be used to infer isotherms. (b) Bouguer gravity maps corrected for regional topography are found to correlate with large silicic intrusive bodies, which are often associated with high heat flow. (c) isotherms and open crack systems at depth can be inferred from seismic wave attenuations, dispersions, and delay times. (d) heat flow measurements are useful as a primary tool and as a check on the results of other methods. Abstracts for individual presentations by the twelve panel members are included. 111 references.
Hydraulic fracture experiments in GT-1 and GT-2\1977\Hydraulic fracturing experiments were conducted in granite rock, at temperatures near 100 and 150/sup 0/C, in two wells 0.785 km (2575 ft) and 1.98 km (6500 ft) deep near Los Alamos, New Mexico. No unusual difficulty was observed in fracturing crystalline rock hydraulically. The apparent surface energy (energy required to create new fracture surface by breaking the rock) was measured as 100 J/m/sup 2/. Orientation of the deeper fracture was measured as N35/sup 0/E (+-5/sup 0/). The fraction of fluid injected into the rock that could be recovered at hydrostatic surface pressure was measured. The efficiency of recovery was as high as 92 percent after the fracture impedance was lowered by ''propping'' the fracture with sand. Permeability of the rock over the face of the fracture was compatible with laboratory measurements (10/sup -7/ to 10/sup -8/ darcys). Downhole pressures required to extend the fractures were about 150 and 340 bars (2175 and 4900 psi), respectively.
Los Alamos Hot Dry Rock Geothermal Energy Project\1977\The LASL Hot Dry Rock Geothermal Energy Project is the only U. S. field test of this geothermal resource. In the LASL concept , a man-made geothermal reservoir would be formed by drilling a deep hole into relatively impermeable hot rocks, creating a large surface area for heat transfer by fracturing the rock hydraulically, then drilling a second hole to intersect the fracture to complete the circulation loop. In 1974. the first hole was drilled to a depth of 2929 m (9610 ft) and a hydraulic fracture was produced near the bottom. ln 1975, a second hole was directionally drilled to intersect the fracture. Although the desired intersection was not achieved, a connection was made through which water can be circulated. After a year's study of the fracture system drilling will begin again in April 1977 to improve the connection. By the fall of 1977, a 10 MW (thermal) heat extraction experiment should be in operation.  
Petrography and geochemistry of precambrian rocks from GT-2 and EE-1\1977\During the drilling of GT-2 and EE-1, 27 cores totaling about 35 m were collected from the Precambrian section. Samples of each different lithology in each core were taken for petrographic and whole-rock major- and trace-element analyses. Whole-rock analyses are now completed on 37 samples. From these data four major Precambrian units were identified at the Fenton Hill site. Geophysical logs and cuttings were used to extrapolate between cores. The most abundant rock type is an extremely variable gneissic unit comprising about 75% of the rock penetrated. This rock is strongly foliated and may range compositionally from syenogranitic to tonalitic over a few centimeters. The bulk of the unit falls within the monzogranite field. Interlayered with the gneiss is a ferrohastingsite-biotite schist which compositionally resembles a basaltic andesite. A fault contact between the schist and gneiss was observed in one core. Intrusive into this metamorphic complex are two igneous rocks. A leucocratic monzogranite occurs as at least two 15-m-thick dikes, and a biotite-granodiorite body was intercepted by 338 m of drill hole. Both rocks are unfoliated and equigranular. The biotite granodiorite is very homogeneous and is characterized by high modal contents of biotite and sphene and by high K/sub 2/O, TiO/sub 2/, and P/sub 2/O/sub 5/ contents. Although all of the cores examined show fractures, most of these are tightly sealed or healed. Calcite is the most abundant fracture filling mineral, but epidote, quartz, chlorite, clays or sulfides have also been observed. The degree of alteration of the essential minerals normally increases as these fractures are approached. The homogeneity of the biotite granodiorite at the bottom of GT-2 and the high degree of fracture filling ensure an ideal setting for the Hot Dry Rock Experiment.
Planning, drilling, logging, and testing of energy extraction hole EE-1, Phases I and II\1977\Energy Extraction Hole No. 1 (EE-1) is the second deep hole drilled into the Precambrian-age granitic rocks of the Jemez Mountains of north-central New Mexico. EE-1 was drilled to intersect a hydraulic fracture extending outward from near the bottom of previously drilled hole GT-2, thus completing the underground circulation loop required for the hot dry rock geothermal energy extraction experiment. Directional drilling techniques were used to intersect the fracture zone. In addition, high-temperature instrumentation and equipment development, hydraulic fracturing experiments, pressure-flow testing of the fracture systems, and fracture mapping and borehole-ranging technique activities were conducted. The drilling, logging, and testing operations in EE-1 are described.
Preliminary Results of Exp. 165\1977\"Exp. 165 was conducted on May 31, 1977. The purpose of the test was to measure the overall impedance for flow between EE-1 and the recently redrilled GT-2B path via a fracture or joint connection at 8770 ft in GT-2B. The uncorrected impedance was 15 psi/qpm, which after correction for buoyancy effects is estimated to be as high as 18 psi/gpm. It appears that the flow arriving at GT-2 is linearly diffusing from EE-1, probably via a narrow, high impedance joint. While at a roughly constant EE-1 pressure of ~900 psi water was lost to the formation at a constant rate of 41 qpm. This quasi-steady state was attained in only 2 hours, remarkably short compared to the � time estimates for the EE-1 system existing before redrilling and fracturing. This suggests that as a result of the post redrilling fracture extension of experiment 161, several natural points had been intersected and/or activated and communicated flow. This further suggests the possibility that the GT-2B intersection is indeed with such a joint. rather than the ""main. 11 low impedance fracture. "
Proceedings of the second NATO-CCMS information meeting on dry hot rock geothermal energy\1977\This report is a summary of the second and last NATO-CCMS (North Atlantic Treaty Organization - Committee on Challenges of Modern Society) Geothermal Pilot Study Information Meeting on Dry Hot Rock Geothermal Energy. Only summaries of the formal presentations are included. Overviews of the Energy Research and Development Administration (ERDA) and the U._s. Geological Survey (USGS) geothermal projects are included with emphasis on the Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory (LASL) Hot Dry Rock Geothermal Energy Development Project. Reports of developments in nine foreign countries and on geothermal projects in U S universities are also presented. 
Experimental geothermal loop: I, 295/sup 0/C study\1978\Reaction of granodiorite from the Fenton Hill Hot Dry Rock Geothermal Site with distilled water at 300/sup 0/C and 345 bars total pressure for 8 months has produced many morphological and chemical effects. Eight polished rock disks were mounted on a tantalum pedestal inside a 500-ml autoclave. The autoclave is part of a circulation system designed for operation to 400/sup 0/C and 345 bars. Solution samples were taken at 32, 56, 176, 368, 752, 1544, 3104, and 5816 h. Rock disks were removed also at the latter four times. The reactivity of phases was shown to be quartz>>microcline>plagioclase>mafics, opaques, and trace phases. Quartz was removed congruently. The albite component of the plagioclase was dissolved essentially congruently changing plagioclase from oligoclase (fresh) to bytownite (8 mo.). Microcline showed congruent dissolution. Other phases were inert. Secondary mineralization included phillipsite, thomsonite, and vermiculite.
GT-2A Pumping Tests: A Lesson in History\1978\"Following the initial redrilling of GT-2 along path GT-2A in May of 1977 , a series of pumping experiments was performed to 11 improve 11 the flow connection(s) between the two wellbores, and then to evaluate the specific flow impedance of the resulting system. However, because we were so enamored with self-propping and afraid of the ""paper dragon,"" runaway fracture extension, this evaluation was confined to the low GT-2A back-pressure data. The corresponding data on the reservoir flow performance under conditions of high back-pressure at GT-2A were essentially ignored. In fact, it now appears that GT-2A was drilled through the primary near-vertical fracture initiated from EE-1 at the Q050 foot depth. This fracture, which intersects the GT-2A wellbore at a depth of approximately 8600 feet, was initially opened up during the brief pressurization of the GT-2A wellbore to 1620 psi at the beginning of Expt. 161. This fracture connection shows up quite clearly on both the post-Expt. 161 and post- Expt. 162 temperature logs of GT-2A, but is barely discernible on the first temperature log run prior to the initial pressurization of the GT-2A wellbore. This intersection of a near-vertical fracture with the GT-2A wellbore had undoubtedly been previously held tightly shut by the wellbore stress concentration, a closure stress of about 1600 psi above s3. "
Proposed enlargement of the EE-1/GT-2B system by recementing the EE-1 casing\1978\A plan is presented here to enlarge the effective heat transfer area of the EE-l/GT-28 system by isolating the high fluid conductivity short path length connections with a recementing of the free casing in EE-1. Long-term pumping on the shut-in system would be employed in order to create additional openings in the natural fracture system. The system would be tested by periodic short-term flows and finally by a sustained reservoir drawdown if a sufficiently low impedance has been attained. It is realized that such an effort would effectively destroy the existing low impedance system and therefore this program would be started only after all methods to improve the present system have been evaluated and tested. It is further realized that such an attempt may not produce a high outlet power system because of lack of natural pathways. However the knowledge gained by such an attempt appears to us to be worth the risk particularly if it occurs prior to a scheduled abandonment of the system. 
Testing, planning, and redrilling of Geothermal Test Hole GT-2, Phases IV and V. Progress report\1978\Holes GT-2 and EE-1 comprise the two deep drill holes of the Los Alamos Hot Dry Rock Geothermal Energy Extraction Experiment. EE-1 had been directionally drilled to intersect a hydraulic fracture extending outward from near the bottom of GT-2, thus completing the underground circulation loop. After the drilling of EE-1, a 16-month period of experimental testing ensued to determine the characteristics of the reservoir. This period is designated as Phase IV and includes work done in GT-2 and EE-1. As a result of this testing, it was determined that parallel fracture zones existed at the bottoms of both holes, and that the impedance to flow between the holes was too high for a meaningful flow experiment. A plan was then adopted to directionally drill out of GT-2 at a depth of about 2600 m (8500 ft) to intersect the fracture zone near the bottom of EE-1 to create a better connection. The directional drilling strategy, cementing practices, bit selections, coring procedures, and logging results comprise the Phase V work.
Thermal stress cracking and the enhancement of heat extraction from fractured geothermal reservoirs\1978\Given sufficient time, the extraction of heat from geothermal reservoirs formed by the hydraulic fracturing of competent rock will eventually result in the formation of thermal stress cracks in the reservoir. These cracks penetrate the rock in a manner such that the penetration-to-spacing ratio is approximately one. The penetration depends upon the extent of cooling and the square root of time. Initially then, the cracks are closely spaced and penetrate but little, so that a crazing pattern is apparent; but with increasing time some of these cracks, now more widely spaced, grow deeper. Eventually these larger cracks attain a critical aperture such that significant rates of water flow can be established within them and thus the newly created heat transfer area becomes useful for heat extraction. At the same time that cracks are forming within the main reservoir, thermal cracking also occurs in the wellbores that communicate with the reservoir. These cracks eventually convey water to and from the reservoir, thus leading to a decrease in the flow impedances that are often concentrated in the wellbore regions.
Capacitive discharge firing system for providing acoustic sources in the hot dry rock geothermal energy development project\1979\The development of a capacitive discharge firing unit designed to initiate electrically exploded foil slapper detonators in a subsurface, high-pressure (5000 psi), high-temperature (> 200/sup 0/C) environment is described. The unit is used to conduct acoustic ranging experiments in deep boreholes (approx. = 10,000 ft) in the Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory Geothermal Hot Dry Rock experiment.
Economic modeling of electricity production from hot dry rock geothermal reservoirs: methodology and analyses. Final report\1979\An analytical methodology is developed for assessing alternative modes of generating electricity from hot dry rock (HDR) geothermal energy sources. The methodology is used in sensitivity analyses to explore relative system economics. The methodology used a computerized, intertemporal optimization model to determine the profit-maximizing design and management of a unified HDR electric power plant with a given set of geologic, engineering, and financial conditions. By iterating this model on price, a levelized busbar cost of electricity is established. By varying the conditions of development, the sensitivity of both optimal management and busbar cost to these conditions are explored. A plausible set of reference case parameters is established at the outset of the sensitivity analyses. This reference case links a multiple-fracture reservoir system to an organic, binary-fluid conversion cycle. A levelized busbar cost of 43.2 mills/kWh ($1978) was determined for the reference case, which had an assumed geothermal gradient of 40/sup 0/C/km, a design well-flow rate of 75 kg/s, an effective heat transfer area per pair of wells of 1.7 x 10/sup 6/ m/sup 2/, and plant design temperature of 160/sup 0/C. Variations in the presumed geothermal gradient, size of the reservoir, drilling costs, real rates of return, and other system parameters yield minimum busbar costs between -40% and +76% of the reference case busbar cost.
Electricity from hot dry rock geothermal energy: technical and economic issues\1979\Extraction of energy from hot dry rock would make available a nearly unlimited energy source. Some of the technical problems and possible economic tradeoffs involved in a power generating system are examined and possible solutions proposed. An intertemporal optimization computer model of electricity production from a hot dry rock geothermal source has been constructed. The effects of reservoir degradation, variable fluid flow rate, and drilling operations are examined to deetermine optimal strategies for reservoir management and necessary conditions for economic feasibility.
Environmental analysis of the Fenton Hill Hot Dry Rock Geothermal Test Site\1979\Techniques for the extraction of geothermal energy from hot dry rock within the earth's crust were tested at the first experimental system at Fenton Hill and proved successful. Because new concepts were being tried and new uses of the natural resources were being made, environmental effects were a major concern. Therefore, at all phases of development and operation, the area was monitored for physical, biological, and social factors. The results were significant because after several extended operations, there were no adverse environmental effects, and no detrimental social impacts were detected. Although these results are specific for Fenton Hill, they are applicable to future systems at other locations.
Flow near the outlet of a geothermal energy reservoir\1979\Steady, incompressible flow converging radially between two stationary, parallel plates was investigated both numerically and experimentally. Flow ranges investigated were laminar, turbulent, and transitional. For laminar flows at dimensionless radii (2r..sqrt pi nu../Qt) much greater than one the velocity profile becomes parabolic and invariant. At radii less than one a boundary layer character evolves with an approximately uniform core region and the boundary layer thickness decreases from one-half the disk spacing to values proportional to the local radii as the flow accelerates towards the center. At large radii the friction factor approaches the classic value obtained for fully developed rectilinear flow between infinite plated, 6..nu../Vt, but at small radii it approaches the constant 2.17/..sqrt..R/sub 0/, where R/sub 0/ is an overall Reynolds number based on the volumetric flow rate and the disk spacing and is independent of radius. Tabular and graphical results are provided for the intermediate range of radii, where both viscous and inertial effects are important, and exact analyses were not available.
Hot dry rock energy extraction field test: 75 days of operation of a prototype reservoir at Fenton Hill, Segment 2 of Phase I\1979\Results from the first extensive field test of a man-made hot dry rock (HDR) geothermal reservoir in low permeability crystalline rock are presented. A reservoir with a small heat transfer area was utilized to study the characteristics of a prototype HDR system over a shortened lifetime. The resulting accelerated thermal drawdown was modeled to yield an effective area of 8000 m/sup 2/. In addition to the thermal effects, this test provided an opportunity to examine equipment operation, water permeation into the formation, geochemical interaction between the circulating fluid and the rock and flow characteristics including impedance and residence time distributions. Continuous monitoring for induced seismic effects showed that no activity to a Richter threshold of -1.0 was detected during the 75-day experiment.
Hot Dry Rock Geothermal Energy Development Program.

Hot dry rock geothermal energy development program. Semiannual report, October 1, 1978-March 31, 1979\1979\The potential of energy extracted from hot dry rock (HDR) was investigated as a commercailly feasible alternate energy source. Run Segments 3 and 4 were completed in the prototype reservoir of the Phase I energy-extraction system at Fenton Hill, New Mexico. Results of these tests yielded significant data on the existing system and this information will be applicable to future HDR systems. Plans and operations initiating a Phase II system are underway at the Fenton Hill site. This system, a deeper, hotter commercial-size reservoir, is intended to demonstrate the longevity and economics of an HDR system. Major activity occurred in evaluation of the national resource potential and in characterizing possible future HDR geothermal sites. Work has begun in the institutional and industrial support area to assess the economics and promote commercial interest in HDR systems as an alternate energy source.
Hot Dry Rock Geothermal Energy Development Program: Annual report, fiscal year 1985\1979\The primary objective for the Hot Dry Rock Program at the Los Alamos National Laboratory during fiscal year 1985 was to complete the Phase 2 reservoir connection and to begin flow testing the resulting reservoir. The connection was achieved through redrilling one well and additional fracturing operations, and progress was made toward developing a detailed understanding of the fractured region through a variety of reservoir interrogation methods. Other accomplishments during the fiscal year included improvement of the high-temperature, inflatable, open-hole packer used to isolate sections of the uncased wellbore in collaboration with the Baker Corporation and the design and fabrication of a high-temperature borehole acoustic televiewer in a cooperative program with a research institute in West Germany. Progress was also made in techniques for the collection and analysis of microseismic data. Reservoir-engineering activities and geochemical studies, as well as the more routine support activities, continued in FY85. 18 refs., 15 figs.
Hot dry rock geothermal energy development program: Annual report, Fiscal year 1986\1979\Preparation, execution, and analysis of a 30-day Initial Closed-Loop Flow Test (ICFT) of the Phase II reservoir were the primary objectives of the Hot Dry Rock Program in fiscal year 1986. The ICFT successfully tested the Phase II heat-extraction loop with the injection of 37,000 m/sup 3/ of cold water and production of 23,000 m/sup 3/ of hot water, extracting up to 10 MW/sub t/ when production reached 0.0139 m/sup 3//s at 192/degree/C. By the end of the test, water loss rate has decreased to 26% and a significant portion of the injected water had been recovered, 66% during the test and an additional 20% during subsequent venting. Geochemical, tracer, and seismic analyses suggest reservoir fracture volume was growing throughout the test. A new technique, the ''three-point'' method, was developed to determine locations and orientations of seismically active planes. Fault or joint planes are identified in what superficially appears to be an amorphous microearthquake location set. Five planes were determined when the three-point method was applied to a location data set for the massive hydraulic-fracturing experiment conducted in 1983. 23 refs., 19 figs., 3 tabs.
Hot Dry Rock Geothermal Energy Development Project. Annual report, fiscal year 1977\1979\The feasibility of extracting geothermal energy from hot dry rock in the earth's crust was investigated. The concept being investigated involves drilling a deep hole, creating an artificial geothermal reservoir at the bottom of the hole by hydraulic fracturing, and then intersecting the fracture with a second borehole. At the beginning of FY77, the downhole system was complete, but the impedance to the flow of fluid was too high to proceed confidently with the planned energy extraction demonstration. Therefore, in FY77 work focused on an intensive investigation of the characteristics of the downhole system and on the development of the necessary tools and techniques for understanding and improving it. Research results are presented under the following section headings: introduction and history; hot dry rock resource assessment and site selection; instrumentation and equipment development; drilling and fracturing; reservoir engineering; energy extraction system; environmental studies; project management and liaison; and, looking back and ahead.

Hot dry rock geothermal energy development project: cablehead assembly. Equipment development report\1979\The development, design, and service history of a multiconductor cablehead capable of operation at 275/sup 0/C and 103 MPa (15,000 psi) are discussed. This high-temperature cablehead has been in service for about 18 months; conclusions drawn from this test period are summarized.
Hot dry rock geothermal reservoir testing: 1978 to 1980\1979\Experimental results and re-evaluation of the Phase I Hot Dry Rock Geothermal Energy reservoirs at the Fenton Hill field site are summarized. This report traces reservoir growth as demonstrated during Run Segments 2 through 5 (January 1978 to December 1980). Reservoir growth was caused not only by pressurization and hydraulic fracturing, but also by heat extraction and thermal contraction effects. Reservoir heat-transfer area grew from 8000 to 50,000 m/sup 2/ and reservoir fracture volume grew from 11 to 266 m/sup 3/. Despite this reservoir growth, the water loss rate increased only 30%, under similar pressure environments. For comparable temperature and pressure conditions, the flow impedance (a measure of the resistance to circulation of water through the reservoir) remained essentially unchanged, and if reproduced in the Phase II reservoir under development, could result in self pumping. Geochemical and seismic hazards have been nonexistent in the Phase I reservoirs. The produced water is relatively low in total dissolved solids and shows little tendency for corrosion or scaling. The largest microearthquake associated with heat extraction measures less than -1 on the extrapolated Richter scale.
Hot dry rock geothermal resource ownership and the law\1979\A basis is provided for changing the design of some legislative definitions of geothermal energy to allow the emergence and implementation of a hot dry rock geothermal energy-producing technology. A study of existing federal and state geothermal statutes has been conducted to determine the extent to which legislation acts to constrain the commercialization of this particular technology. A definitional problem has been identified and a solution presented. This report clarifies the distinctions between the several geothermal resources, describes the recognized resource ownership problem and present state of the law, and presents a solution for consideration including a discussion that establishes the reasons for change.
Results of Expt. 186, the High Back-Pressure Flow Experiment\1979\Experiment 186, the High Back-Pressure Flow Experiment, has contributed significantly to our understanding of HOR reservoir flow processes, and pointed to a revised method of reservoir pressure management for the forthcoming 20 Mw heat extraction experiment. For the increased flow rates anticipated for this experiment -- up to 40 kg/sec -- operation in a high back-pressure flow mode may offer several advantages: lower surface injection pressures and consequently reduced water loss rates when compared to low back-pressure flow operation. During Experiment 186, it was conclusively demonstrated that by pressurizing the exit wellbore, the reservoir flow impedance can be reduced to a very low value: about 0.4 psi/gpm. The strong implication is that at fracture exit pressurization levels close to the least principal earth stress, the high fracture-to-wellbore exit flow impedance existing under previous low back-pressure flow conditions is eliminated. Although the hoped-for large increase in heat transfer surface was not obtained, under the somewhat higher mean pressure level existing throughout this experiment, buoyant circulation -- and therefore enhanced heat extraction -- may be occurring in the main fracture. 
Thermal fracture effects in geothermal energy extraction\1979\Heat and water exchange between the primary crack and a lateral thermal fracture are analyzed by means of numerical modeling on a high-speed computer. Three-dimensional heat flow in the rock is coupled to a two-dimensional approximation for the time-varying convective patterns that result from both forced flow and buoyancy. The physical and mathematical bases for the study are described together with the numerical technique for solution. The report includes listing of three versions of the computer code and some results of representative calculations.
Basic research needed for the development of geothermal energy\1980\Basic research needed to facilitate development of geothermal energy is identified. An attempt has been made to make the report representative of the ideas of productive workers in the field. The present state of knowledge of geothermal energy is presented and then specific recommendations for further research, with status and priorities, are listed. Discussion is limited to a small number of applicable concepts, namely: origin of geothermal flux; transport of geothermal energy; geothermal reservoirs; rock-water interactions, and geophysical and geochemical exploration.
Bibliography of the geological and geophysical aspects of hot dry rock geothermal resources\1980\This is the first issue of an annual compilation of references that are useful to the exploration, understanding and development of the hot dry rock geothermal resource.
Eastern hot dry rock target prospect: a case history\1980\The Eastern Hot Dry Rock Target Prospect is located in a corridor between Smith Island, Maryland on Chesapeake Bay and the southern tip of Assateague Island, Virginia on the Atlantic Ocean. The prospect was selected for investigation based on anomalously high heat flow values and thermal gradients previously determined. The exploration program was aimed at locating the most favorable location within the site area for the targeting of a deep test borehole for HDR heat extraction. The program consisted of an aeromagnetic survey, gravity/magnetic analysis, time-domain electromagnetic (TDEM) survey, Vibroseis seismic reflection profiling, drilling and logging of four 300-meter borings, and the reopening and logging of an abandoned oil exploration hole. The preliminary results of this nearly completed study indicate that the area has potential for the extraction of heat using the Hot Dry Rock concept.
Geologic map of the Sulphur Springs Area, Valles Caldera Geothermal System, New Mexico\1980\The geologic and tectonic setting and geology of Sulphur Springs Area are described. Geologic faults, sheared or brecciated rock, volcanic vents, geothermal wells, hydrothermal alteration, springs, thermal springs, fumaroles, and geologic deposits are indicated on the map. (MHR)
Geology of the Phase II System\1980\Cuttings analysis has been completed for the lower portion of the EE-2 wellbore and a preliminary geologic evaluation of the reservoir rock for the Phase II system can now be made. As opposed to the single lithology Phase I reservoir (GT-2, EE-1), the much more extensive Phase II reservoir (EE-2, EE-3) encompasses a wide variety of rock types. The different rock types in this reservoir imply variable petro-physical properties including thermal conductivity, permeability, porosity, heat capacity, and density. As these properties ,effectively control factors such as the rate of thermal drawdown and recovery of the HDR geothermal reservoir, it is evident that the Phase II system will involve additional complexities not encountered in Phase I. On the other hand, due to the contrasting nature of the two reservoirs, the HDR concept can now be tested in two essentially different environments. The Phase I reservoir was developed in a relatively homogeneous rock type; Phase II encompasses both igneous and metamorphic rock types with a wide range of compositions (locally the metamorphic rocks could be folded and several large faults, and possibly numerous minor ones, cut through this deeper reservoir). 
Geothermal energy enhancement by thermal fracture. [REX (Rock Energy Extraction)]\1980\A large, vertical, circular fracture created deep within hot rock is connected to the surface through two holes. The inlet provides a source of cold water and the outlet extracts heated water. Cooling of the rock produces thermal stresses that fracture the rock adjacent to the primary crack, thereby enhancing the heat extraction rate by means of convective transport. The properties of the thermal fracture network vary with position and time. The REX code for high-speed computer was written and used to study the coupled processes of primary-crack flow and lateral thermal fracture heat transport. Calculations for elapsed times of 100 y show that thermal fracture enhancement can double the heat extraction rate over the results from conduction alone. Long-term enhancement predictions depend on data from rock-mechanics studies, which the REX code is prepared to accept as they become available.
Geothermal potential of West-Central New Mexico from geochemical and thermal gradient data\1980\To study the low temperature and Hot Dry Rock (HDR) geothermal potential of west-central New Mexico, 46 water samples were collected and geothermal gradient measurements were made in 29 wells. Water chemistry data indicate that all the samples collected are meteoric waters. High temperatures of samples taken from wells between Gallup and Tohatchi indicate these wells may derive water from a warm aquifer below the depth of the wells. The chemistries of the samples farther south on the Zuni Indian reservation suggest these waters are not circulating below 600 m of the surface. Geothermometry calculations support the conclusion that the waters sampled are meteoric. The geothermometry also indicates that the deep reservoir between Gallup and Tohatchi may be greater than 60/sup 0/C. Thermal gradient data indicate an area of high gradient on the Zuni Indian Reservation with a measured maximum of 67/sup 0/C/km between 181 m and 284 m. This high probably is not hydrologically controlled. The maximum gradients in the study area are 76/sup 0/C/km and 138/sup 0/C/km, measured just east of Springerville, Arizona. These gradients are undoubtedly controlled by circulating water, possibly heated by a magmatic source at depth and circulating back to the surface.
Hot Dry Rock Geothermal Energy Development Program. Annual report, fiscal year 1979\1980\The Fenton Hill Project is still the principal center for developing methods, equipment, and instrumentation for creating and utilizing HDR geothermal reservoirs. The search for a second site for a similar experimental system in a different geological environment has been intensified, as have the identification and characterization of other HDR areas that may prove suitable for either experimental or commercial development. The Phase I fracture system was enlarged during FY79. Drilling of the injection well of the Phase II system began at Fenton Hill in April 1979. Environmental monitoring of the Fenton Hill area continued through FY79. The environmental studies indicate that the hot dry rock operations have caused no significant environmental impact. Other supporting activities included rock physics, rock mechanics, fracture mapping, and instrumentation development. Two closely related activities - evaluation of the potential HDR energy resource of the US and the selection of a site for development of a second experimental heat-extraction system generally similar to that at Fenton Hill - have resulted in the collection of geology, hydrology, and heat-flow data on some level of field activity in 30 states. The resource-evaluation activity included reconnaissance field studies and a listing and preliminary characterization of US geothermal areas in which HDR energy extraction methods may be applicable. The selection of Site 2 has taken into account such legal, institutional, and economic factors as land ownership and use, proximity to possible users, permitting and licensing requirements and procedures, environmental issues, areal extent of the geothermal area, and visibility to and apparent interest by potential industrial developers.
Microseismic Activity Recorded During Experiment 217\1980\Recently we recorded two microseismic events that were within 1.0 km of TA-57. They occurred on April l at 04:32 GMT and 14:26 GMT. They had a local magnitude of approximately -3 and were recorded on only two stations (Lake Fork Canyon deep well station and close in station Q-3). Since only two stations recorded these events, it is not possible to set an accurate location. The data did show S-P times that indicate that one of the events ( 14: 26 Z) had a depth ranging between l. 5 km and 1.8 km (4900 ft to 5900 ft). The other event (04:32 Z) appears to be shallower with a probable depth ranging between 0.6 km and 1.0 km (2000 ft to 3300 ft). Both events appear to be very close to the GT-2, EE-1, and EE-2 hole complex (but at some depth as stated above). These microseismic events are the first such signals observed during Experiment 217 (a total of seven microseismic events with local magnitudes ranging from -2.5 to -1.5 were seen during the high pressure phase of Experiment 215 - see previous Homuth memo dated 11/19/79). Although microseismic signals of this energy pose no threat to the continuation of Experiment 217, they do indicate that we will surely detect any seismic emissions greater than local magnitude -2.5 within three kilometers of TA-57. This is an important capability in assessing any seismicity associated with HOR experiments and operations at TA-57 or at any future HOR sites. For those of you with a seismological inclination, I have attached a copy of the playbacks of the two microseismic signals observed on 4/1/80. The signal to noise ratio is not the greatest, but even an untrained observer could identify the signals. 
Preliminary study of the potential environmental concerns associated with surface waters and geothermal development of the Valles Caldera\1980\A preliminary evaluation is presented of possible and probable problems that may be associated with hydrothermal development of the Valles Caldera Known Geothermal Resource Area (KGRA), with specific reference to surface waters. Because of the history of geothermal development and its associated environmental impacts, this preliminary evaluation indicates the Valles Caldera KGRA will be subject to these concerns. Although the exact nature and size of any problem that may occur is not predictable, the baseline data accumulated so far have delineated existing conditions in the streams of the Valles Caldera KGRA. Continued monitoring will be necessary with the development of geothermal resources. Further studies are also needed to establish guidelines for geothermal effluents and emissions.
Pressure transient testing of a manmade fractured geothermal reservoir: an examination of fracture versus matrix dominated flow effects\1980\The data analysis is in terms of a diffusion equation that determines the flow of water and hence the pressure in the main fracture system, associated joints, and the matrix permeability. The fits of the flow data to type curve solutions of the diffusion equation with pressure-dependent properties for various flow geometries are presented. The following points are considered in detail. (1) The limits on the fracture geometry, aperture, and diffusing areas are determined from the diffusion parameters. (2) Dependence of the parameters (impedance, diffusivity) of the flow-through systems are related to the inflation of the major fractures. (3) The rock properties are related to the reservoir compressibility and permeability. In particular, laboratory experiments have shown that the properties of all sizes of cracks from large single fractures to the microstructure are pressure dependent if the fluid pressure is near the confining stress. The effects of this pressure dependence on the form of the type curves are included. (4) The competition of flow into the various types of porosity (main fractures, joints, and microstructure) and the effect on the interpretation of type curves are considered. The approach described makes an important departure from conventional pressure-transient reservoir analysis in that pressure-dependent properties are incorporated into a numerically simulated generation of type curves resulting from one- and two-dimensional diffusion. In addition, the problem of specifying a unique flow geometry where both matrix and fracture-dominated, non-Darcy flow effects are possible is analyzed using a large amount of field and laboratory data in conjunction with a theoretical treatment that reviews the existing state of the art in reservoir mechanics.
Report on Phase 1, Segment 5, Stage 1 (Start-Up of Experiment 217)\1980\Experiment 217 is a long-term (3 to 6 months) heat extraction experiment in the new EE-l/GT-2B circulation system, with flow entrance at 2.93 km (9620 ft) depth and flow exit in the open hole section of GT-2B which extends from 2.61 km (8550 ft) to 2.71 km (8900 ft) depth. In order to characterize the fracture system as the experiment began, some parameters which have been shown to be flow and pressure dependent were measured at various flow rates and pressure levels, with flow injection into GT-2B as well as EE- l . 
Reservoir Engineering Report for November 1980\1980\Total makeup and EE-1 annulus flow rates are 28 and 21 gpm respectively, indicating a net loss of 7 gpm, typical of downhole losses that prevailed before the EE-1 annulus began leaking. Computer matches with the data, using the wellbore heat transmission code WBHT indicates that the temperature of the leakage flow entering the EE-1 annulus at 8900 ft is about 150�C, indicating that this flow transits a significant fraction of the reservoir system before entering the annulus. Additional calculations indicate that the annulus flow rate could increase to as high as 200 9pm during the high pressure stress unlocking experiment scheduled for Dec. 8-12 before boiling would occur in the annulus. 
Application of fluid-chemistry studies to a hot-dry-rock geothermal system: I. Neutron-activation studies\1981\Neutron activation analysis methods were developed for determination of element concentrations in geothermal system waters, bulk rock samples, separated mineral phases, and intergranular salts from a hot dry rock geothermal system. Selected trace and major element concentrations were determined by neutron activation for: (1) 39 water samples taken during the course of a 75 day experimental run of the Fenton Hill hot dry rock system, including both the injected cool water (including makeup water) and the heated water emerging from the system; (2) a bulk rock core section from 8904 ft. (2714 m); (3) each of the 7 major mineral phases present in the rock; and (4) a sample of intergranular salts obtained by leaching the disaggregated rock at 25/sup 0/C.
Brief History of HDR Fenton Hill Drilling\1981\Although many difficult drilling problems were encountered throughout the Fenton Hill HDR Project, persistence, fortitude, and hard work (not to mention lots of bucks) have provided the means for the successful completion of all Fenton Hill geothermal wells in a very high-risk environment. The companion hydraulic fracturing operations and energy extraction experiments have also been achieved solving additional technical programmatic goals under equally adverse conditions (subject of future summary). A summary of drilling operations at Fenton Hill follows. 
Comparison of EE-1 Temperature Logs from Exp 215 through Exp 217 to Previous Logs\1981\"The review of available temperature surveys conducted in EE-1 has been updated, following the format of the previous mems, 1) �11 The Growing Number of EE-1 Connections,"" G-3/77/#52 (8/18/77) and 2) ""Comparison of Exp. 205 Temperature Logs with Previous Logs,"" (4/2/79). The temperature logs presented here are all plotted to the same depth scale for ease of comparison. All depths plotted are logging cable depths and depths referred to here will be cable depths. Figures 1-3 are composites of the most recent temperature logs which have no previously been discussed. Figures 4-27 are individual EE-1 temperature logs presented in chronological order. Table 1 is a summary of the available non-flowing logs and depths at which flow connections may be seen. To summarize, EE-1 temperature logs have shown ten connections through time. Connection 1 was apparent by 10-20-75 and can be seen on most of the temperature logs. However, from the time of the 75-day heat extraction test (1-28-78 to 4-13-78) until Exp. 205 (3-28-79) it was very difficult or impossible to distinguish (Figures 12-16). After the recementing and MHF operations of 3/79 this connection reappeared as a distinct temperature depression (Figure 17). Connections 5 and 6 were the next to appear on the log of 2-9-76 (Figure 5). They last appear as two distinct connections on the log of 9-5-78 (Figure 14). From then on they generally appear as one depression on the temperature logs. "
Development of the Phase I Fenton Hill HDR Reservoir: Part I, Fracture Dimension\1981\Sufficient data now exists to allow a description of the general and probable growth of the Fenton Hill HDR reservoir. The reservoir discussed here is that associated with the original EE-1 to GT-2B connection (Phase I, Segments 2 and 3) and the EE-1 to GT-2B connection after the recementing of the EE-1 casing (Phase I, Segments 4 and 5). Many aspects of the reservoir development are discussed in Refs. 1 through 3. Here the growth and general characteristics of the reservoir are discussed in terms of the general aspects of the pressure transient, tracer, and temperature measurements. Much of the existing data has not been analyzed in terms of specific flow models. Any model must satisfy all data sets to be acceptable. Only in this manner will non-unique interpretations of the data be eliminated. In particular some remaining modeling possibilities are the inclusion of the following in specific flow models. 
Development of the Phase I HDR Reservoir: Part II, General Characteristics\1981\In Part I of this memo the growth of the Phase I reservoir was traced in terms of changes in the following parameters. The relation of the long-term water loss to reservoir size and exchange area. The relation of the loci of microseismic events to reservoir and heat exchange area. The recent (81/03/17) post Expt. 217 temperature log in EE-1 and the possibility of reservoir growth during Expt. 217. The data for the water loss during Expt. 217 and the status of the analysis is discussed in Appendix C. The water loss is only 30 percent higher than that of Segment 2. The heat exchange area was a factor of 2.5 to 5 larger during Expt. 217 than during Segment 2 (see Part I of this memo). Also estimates of a diffusion area associated with the water losses indicate a limiting area many times the heat exchange area (Ref. 4). An obvious conclusion is that the heat exchange system utilizes a small portion of a much larger fracture system that controls water loss. 
Dynamic Moduli for the Phase I System Calculated from the 1977 and 1978 Dresser Atlas\1981\The 1977 and 1978 Dresser Atlas acoustic experiments provided a good measure of the P-wave velocity in the Phase 1 system (Fehler 1981). However, not enough good S-wave arrivals were present in any step to allow Fehler to calculate S-wave velocities using a velocity hyperbola. This is unfortunate because I need the S-wave velocity to calculate dynamic moduli from the seismic velocities. In this memo I describe a method for calculating the S-wave velocity without making a velocity hyperbola and I calculate S-wave velocities and dynamic moduli for the Phase 1 system in 1978. 
Evaluation of the second hot dry rock geothermal energy reservoir: results of Phase I, Run Segment 5\1981\The results of a long-term (286 day) flow test of the second hot dry rock reservoir at the Fenton Hill field site are presented. This second reservoir was created by fracturing an interval of granitic rock located at a depth of 2.93 km (9620 ft) in the same wellbore pair used in the creation of the first, smaller reservoir. The new fracture system has a vertical extent of at least 320 m (1050 ft), suggesting that the combined heat-transfer area of the old and new fracture systems is much greater than that of the old system. The virgin rock temperature at the bottom of the deeper interval was 197/sup 0/C (386/sup 0/F). Downhole measurements of the water temperature at the reservoir outlet, as well as temperatures inferred from geothermometry, showed that the thermal drawdown of the reservoir was about 8/sup 0/C, and preliminary estimates indicate that the minimum effective heat-transfer area of the new reservoir is 45,000 m/sup 2/ (480,000 ft/sup 2/), which is six times larger than the first reservoir.
Fracture Volume Growth and Fluid Mixing in the Phase I System\1981\A complete review of the tracer test data from Segments 2 through 5 has revealed pertinent information regarding the growth of the reservoir. Several parameters have been correlated with observed changes in the flow through reservoir volume as measured by both sodium fluorescein and bromine (Br 82 ) tracers. These include the effects of thermal energy removal, pressurization including massive hydraulic fracturing, and wellbore separation distance on the reservoir volume. Ultimately, we would like to correlate measured tracer volumes with effective heat transfer surface. In addition, the interpretation of tracer volume changes could be used to develop improved methods of reservoir operation -- for example, remedial pressurization for stress relief (like SUE) or a huff-puff operation mode in contrast to our normal (stress-constrained) continuous mode of extracting heat, 
Geology and geochemistry of samples from Los Alamos National Laboratory HDR Well EE-2, Fenton Hill, New Mexico\1981\Petrologic, geochemical, and structural analyses of cores and cuttings obtained from 3000 to 4389-m true vertical depth in drill hole EE-2 indicate that this deeper part of the Precambrian section at Fenton Hill, New Mexico is composed primarily of a very heterogeneous and structurally anisotropic metamorphic complex, locally intruded by dikes and sills of granodioritic and monzogranitic composition. In this borehole none of these igneous bodies approach in size the 335-m-thick biotite-granodiorite body encountered at 2591-m depth beneath Fenton Hill in the other two drill holes. Contacts between the igneous and metamorphic rocks range from sharp and discordant to gradational. Analysis of cuttings indicates that clay-rich alteration zones are relatively common in the openhole portion of EE-2. These zones average about 20 m in thickness. Fracture sets in the Precambrian basement rock intersected by the EE-2 well bore mostly trend northeast and are steeply dipping to vertical; however, one of the sets dips gently to the northwest. Slickensided fault planes are present in a core (No.5) taken from a true vertical depth of 4195 m. Available core orientation data and geologic inference suggest that the faults dip steeply and trend between N.42/sup 0/ and 59/sup 0/E.
Geothermal resource base of the world: a revision of the Electric Power Research Institute's estimate\1981\Review of the Electric Power Research Institute's (EPRI) method for calculating the geothermal resource base of a country shows that modifications are needed for several of the assumptions used in the calculation. These modifications include: (1) separating geothermal belts into volcanic types with a geothermal gradient of 50{sup 0}C/km and complex types in which 80% of the area has a temperature gradient of 30{sup 0}C/km and 20% has a gradient of 45{sup 0}C/km, (2) using the actual mean annual temperature of a country rather than an assumed 15{sup 0}C average ambient temperature, and (3) making separate calculations for the resource stored in water/brine and that stored in rock. Comparison of this method (Revised EPRI) for calculating a geothermal resource base with other resource base estimates made from a heat flow map of Europe indicates that the technique yields reasonable values. The calculated geothermal resource bases, stored in water and rock to a depth of 5 km, for each country in the world are given. Approximately five times as much energy is stored in rock as is stored in water.
HDR Fracture Planning\1981\We have been asked by DOE in Washington to make program adjustments which reflect different funding scenarios for FY82. We find it impossible to plan the program until the large uncertainties regarding the cost of the Phase II fracture operations are in hand. The goal of the FY82 fracturing activities is to create multiple fractures, thereby connecting the two well bores, and to flow the new system. It is our understanding that three types of downhole operations are being considered: We have asked Rod Spence to call a meeting of the Fracture Planning Committee at R:00 am on Tuesday, October 27, in the ESS-Division Conference Room (White Rock) to provide us with the following information: Cost estimates to perform operation. For this analysis, ignore total program budget and concentrate on field costs for each individual option. Please quote technical costs which are as efficient as possible but realistic. Contingencies will be considered later. Time estimates. Potential risks. Technical pros and cons. Other factors (i.e:, politics, etc.)  
HDR Rock Mechanics – August 1981\1981\"Testing of samples from EE-2 at high temperatures and pressures continues. Data from samples 13962 and 11739 is attached. Thermal expansion coefficients show a broad range from sample to sample. Sample 11739 gives a value of about 14 ppm/�C at high temperatures and pressures. Sample 13962 shows a decrease in modulus on going from room to high temperatures. Bulk modulus decreases from about 40 GPa to about 32 GPa at 247�C. Young's modulus declines from around 16 GPa at 24�C to around 10 GPa at 244�C. Further data reduction is needed on 11739 before this comparison can be made. Al 1 these moduli measurements are conducted under poorly drained conditions where the pore fluid pressure changes do not have time to diffuse. Further testing of cement used for EE-3 casing has been done. A long-term test is now underway. Some samples are being cooked at 200�C and water vapor pressure for at least six months. They will then be tested for strength, modulus, and mineralogy changes. The effect of the intermediate principal stress on hydraulic fracturing from an inclined hole is being studied. Tests are being done in 6"" cubes of plexiglass. Most of the experimental problems have now been solved so I should be getting some usable data soon. These tests are being given a high priority, so other measurements will be delayed. "
Hot dry rock geothermal energy development program. Annual report, fiscal year 1980\1981\Investigation and flow testing of the enlarged Phase I heat-extraction system at Fenton Hill continued throughout FY80. Temperature drawdown observed at that time indicated an effective fracture of approximately 40,000 to 60,000 m/sup 2/. In May 1980, hot dry rock (HDR) technology was used to produce electricity in an interface demonstration experiment at Fenton Hill. A 60-kVA binary-cycle electrical generator was installed in the Phase I surface system and heat from about 3 kg/s of geothermal fluid at 132/sup 0/C was used to boil Freon R-114, whose vapor drove a turboalternator. A Phase II system was designed and is now being constructed at Fenton Hill that should approach commercial requirements. Borehole EE-2, the injection well, was completed on May 12, 1980. It was drilled to a vertical depth of about 4500 m, where the rock temperature is approximately 320/sup 0/C. The production well, EE-3 had been drilled to a depth of 3044 m and drilling was continuing. Environmental monitoring of Fenton Hill site continued. Development of equipment, instruments, and materials for technical support at Fenton Hill continued during FY80. Several kinds of models were also developed to understand the behavior of the Phase I system and to develop a predictive capability for future systems. Data from extensive resource investigations were collected, analyzed, and assembled into a geothermal gradient map of the US, and studies were completed on five specific areas as possible locations for HDR Experimental Site 2.
Hot-dry-rock geothermal-energy development program. Annual report, fiscal year 1981\1981\During fiscal year 1981, activities of the Hot Dry Rock Geothermal Energy Development Program were concentrated in four principal areas: (1) data collection to permit improved estimates of the hot dry rock geothermal energy resource base of various regions of the United States and of the United States as a whole, combined with detailed investigations of several areas that appear particularly promising either for further energy extraction experiments or for future commercial development; (2) successful completion of a 9-month, continuous, closed-loop, recirculating flow test in the enlarged Phase I System at Fenton Hill, New Mexico - a pressurized-water heat-extraction loop developed in low-permeability granitic rock by hydraulic fracturing; (3) successful completion at a depth of 4084 m (13,933 ft) of well EE-3, the production well of a larger, deeper, and hotter, Phase II System at Fenton Hill. Well EE-3 was directionally drilled with control of both azimuth and inclination. Its inclined section is about 380 m (1250 ft) vertically above the injection well, EE-2, which was completed in FY80; and (4) supporting activities included new developments in downhole instrumentation and equipment, geochemical and geophysical studies, rock-mechanics and fluid-mechanics investigations, computer analyses and modeling, and overall system design. Under an International Energy Agency agreement, the New Energy Development Organization, representing the Government of Japan has joined Kernforschungsanlage-Juelich GmbH, representing the Federal Republic of Germany, and the US Department of Energy as an active participant in the Fenton Hill Hot Dry Rock Project.
Relaxation of geothermal-reservoir stresses induced by heat production\1981\Fifteen million kWh of thermal energy were produced during 281 days of operation of the hot dry rock (HDR) geothermal reservoir at Fenton Hill, New Mexico. Following this heat production the thermal stresses and strains so induced were partially released by a short, 7-h pressurization of the reservoir above the local tectonic confining stress. Following the partial stress release, it was found that the resistance to water flow through the reservoir was decreased by 37%, and that the reservoir volume, as measured by tracer studies, increased by 43%. Microseismic events recorded with geophones in two deep wells at positions within a few hundred meters of the reservoir were concentrated in those regions of the reservoir most affected by thermal depletion. These events define a reservoir region and size in qualitative agreement with estimates based upon heat production modeling.
Some results of a long-term flow test of a hot-dry-rock reservoir\1981\Results from a 286-day flow test of a new hot dry rock reservoir created at Fenton Hill in the Jemez Mountains in northwest New Mexico are presented. The reservoir was created by fracturing an interval of granitic rock at a depth of 2.93 km (9620 ft). The system was formed from a recemented wellbore pair used to create the first hot dry rock reservoir. The undisturbed rock temperature at the bottom of the new reservoir was 197/sup 0/C. With a nominal outlet flow of 5.7 x 10/sup -3/ m/sup 3//s (95 gpm), the reservoir showed a thermal drawdown of about 8/sup 0/C. A preliminary estimate of the heat transfer area is 45,000 m/sup 3/ (480,000 ft/sup 2/). The water loss rate to the formation was 4.6 x 10/sup -4/ m/sup 3//s (7 gpm). The flow impedance was 1.6 GPa s/M/sup 3/ (15 psi/gpm). The results of the flow test show that in comparison with the earlier smaller hot dry rock system at the same site, the large increase in heat transfer area was accompanied by only a small increase in the water loss and with the impedance staying essentially constant.
Use of a Hydraulically Bulged Liner for Hydraulic Fracturing in EE-2\1981\"At a recent meeting in the ESS Division Office, I protested vigorously against initiating an intensive program to develop hydraulically bulged liners for isolation of hydraulically fractured zones in HDR injection wells -- and specifically in EE-2 at Fenton Hill. I did not increase my popularity in some quarters by doing so (which was not my purpose), and I was neither opposing the advancement of science and technology nor exhibiting a ""not-invented-here"" complex. I was simply expressing a real doubt that such a system could be made to work; the feeling that its proponents had not yet identified all of its major problems; and the conviction that we could not afford the money or manpower which would be required to investigate those problems in the next few months or even years. Perhaps I was wrong about those things, and I do recognize many advantages in a liner bulged at intervals along its length--if it can indeed be installed and made to operate as its advocates believe it can. Therefore, for the consideration of interested parties, I will list and explain my major concerns about hydraulically bulged liners. "
A Fracturing Plan\1982\The Reservoir Development Committee was established by John Whetten on 9/25/81 as one of five committees to plan the Phase II fracturing operations. The membership of this committee consists ~f: H. Murphy, Chairman; L. Aamodt, Alternate Chairman; Z. Dash (replacerl H. Fisher 11-1-81), D. Dreesen, J. Hill (withdrawn when appointed program manager), H. Keppler, M. Kuriyaqawa, A. W. Laughlin, J. Rowley (appointed Feb. 1, 1982), R. Potter and G. Zyvoloski. In addition to these official members, the committee has also enjoyed the unofficial membership of J. Albright, G. Bennett, D. Brown, B. Hoffers, M. Smith, R. Spence and F. Walter. Below we make no distinction between types of members and refer to them all, some 17 in number simply as members. Because some of the recommendations we list below are fairly controversial, perhaps some brief indication of the measure of support enjoyed by these recommendations should be provided. The committee is least supportive of the use of packers - about one-third of the members wish to avoid packers altogether in view of their low probability of working, but the rest of the members are willing to at least give the Guiberson packer a chance. On the other hand the committee is most supportive of method 2 listed below, the Open Hole Pressurization and Thermal Stress Cracking Method, often referred to in various guises as the Aamodt or Fisher method. With the possible exception of four members who were not present when we polled at the last meeting (2-22-82) this method wc1s approved, or known to the chairman to be approved, by all other members. A similar situation exists regarding the use of explosives, but with perhaps more a note of neutral, rather than enthusiastic, approval. 
Candidate sites for future hot-dry-rock development in the United States\1982\Generalized geologic and other data are tabulated for 24 potential hot dry rock (HDR) sites in the contiguous United States. The data show that HDR resources occur in many geologic and tectonic settings. Potential reservoir rocks at each prospect are described and each system is cateogrized accoridng to inferred heat sources. The Fenton Hill area in New Mexico is discussed in detail because this region may be considered ideal for HDR development. Three other prospectively valuable localities are described: The Geysers-Clear lake region in California, the Roosevelt Hot Springs area in Utah, and the White Mountains region in New Hampshire. These areas are singled out to illustrate the roles of significantly different geology and geophysics, reservoir rocks, and reservoir heat contents in possible HDR developments.
Data Package for Experiment 2025\1982\This package contains the entire set of data we collected during Experiment 2025. There has been no attempt at analysis of the data (especially the seismic data). The preliminary results of the experiment are: approximately 153,000 gallons total were injected into EE~3 at 20 barrels per minute. Start-up included flow steps of 2, 5, 9, 14, and 20 bpm. No clear breakdown was observed, however, a brief pump at approximately 1/2 bpm gave a pressure plateau at 4700 psi. A great deal of seismic activity was recorded and locations of seismic events were calculated on-site. Several events were recorded on the surface net and one event appears to have a local magnitude of -1. 
Determining the True Residence Time Distribution Curve of Phase I System\1982\"Previous engineering analyses of the Br82 tracer experiments failed to account for the fact that the fluid was being recirculated during these tests. Thus, the concentration vs. volume curves shown in the Run Segments 4 and 5 reports and elsewhere are not really the response of the system to a pulse of tracer. These data are complicated by the fact that at later times most of the tracer being measured was not the original pulse, but the tracer on its second or third pass through the reservoir. When this recirculation effect is subtracted out of the original concentration vs. volume curves, the true residence time distribution (RTD) for the Phase I system indicates that the ""long tail"" on these curves is not caused by dispersion but results almost entirely from recirculation. The RTD curve for this system cannot be modeled precisely using a one parameter model, but can probably be described by a combination of hydrodynamic and turbulent dispersion in a single fracture. Alternatively, flow through multiple fractures could easily result in the RTD curves determined during Run Segments 4 and 5. "
Drilling of hot-dry-rock geothermal-energy extraction well EE-3\1982\The drilling of EE-3, the production well of the hot dry rock geothermal energy-extraction engineering system at the Fenton Hill site, was finished August 25, 1981. EE-3 was designed to be directionally drilled in the inclined reservoir section to be parallel to and spaced vertically 370 m (1200 ft) above EE-2, the injection well, which was drilled at 35/sup 0/ to the vertical. The reservoir heat transfer area will be formed by creating and extending several vertical parallel hydraulic fractures from EE-2 to EE-3. EE-3 required precision directional drilling because the borehole trajectory had to be drilled within specified tolerances with respect to EE-2. Well EE-2 was drilled with a packed (stiff) bottom-hole assembly that held the 35/sup 0/ inclination, but permitted the borehole to turn in azimuth. Directional drilling experience in EE-2 provided the basis to optimize the directional trajectory of EE-3 to within the desired tolerances. The EE-3 well was drilled into hot granite reservoir rock to total depth of 370 m (1200 ft) parallel and above EE-2 at a measured (drill-string) depth of 4.25 km (13,933 ft), with a maximum lateral deviation of about 60 m (180 ft). A bottom-hole static temperature of 280/sup 0/C (550/sup 0/F) is estimated. Two severe drill-pipe twist-offs extended the drilling time of EE-3 to 461 days. These, and other drilling problems, are recorded and solution approaches are discussed. Drilling costs of EE-2/EE-3 are shown to be comparable to commercial drilling of hydrothermal wells and to the US Department of Energy sponsored geothermal projects when these cost trends are extrapolated to 4.5-km (15,000-ft) depths.
Economics of a 75-MW(e) hot-dry-rock geothermal power station based upon the design of the Phase II reservoir at Fenton Hill\1982\Based upon EE-2 and EE-3 drilling costs and the proposed Fenton Hill Phase II reservoir conditions the break-even cost of producing electricity is 4.4 cents per kWh at the bus bar. This cost is based upon a 9-well, 12-reservoir hot dry rock (HDR) system producing 75 MW(e) for 10 yr with only 20% drawdown, and an assumed annual finance charge of 17%. Only one-third of the total, potentially available heat was utilized; potential reuse of wells as well as thermal stress cracking and augmentation of heat transfer was ignored. Nearly half the bus bar cost is due to drilling expenses, which prompted a review of past costs for wells GT-2, EE-1, EE-2, and EE-3. Based on comparable depth and completion times it is shown that significant cost improvements have been accomplished in the last seven years. Despite these improvements it was assumed for this study that no further advancements in drilling technology would occur, and that even in commercially mature HDR systems, drilling problems would continue nearly unabated.
EE-2 Core\1982\Attached is a report concerning the petrography of core from EE-2. Special emphasis has been placed on fractures. Unfortunately, there is no orientation data available for these cores. Core 1 consists of two lithologic units. The majority of the core (~90%) is a coarse-grained mesocratic biotite-granodiorite gneiss that has been intruded by a fine-grained leucocratic granodiorite. The biotite-granodiorite gneiss is predominantly composed of quartz, plagioclase, and biotite with minor opaques, alkali feldspar, epidote, sphene, and allanite. It also contains trace amounts of myrmekite, zircon, calcite, chlorite, and apatite. The gneissic banding is fairly distinct, however the mafic minerals (predominantly biotite) are segregated into irregular, elongate patches (up to 2 cm in length) giving the rock a distinctively mottled appearance. Quartz grains usually have sutured grain boundaries and exhibit undulose extinction. There is copious seritization of plagioclase and calcite is a minor alteration product. Biotite is present in amounts of up to 20% and shows only very minor alteration to chlorite. The opaque minerals are mostly magnetite and compose 1-2% of the rock. Magnetite is often associated with epidote, sphene, and/or allanite. 
EE-2 Fracture Initiation by Simultaneous Wellbore Cooling and Pressurization\1982\One of the more significant though generally unrecognized technical achievements of the HDR program has been the demonstration, of multiple fracture initiation by simultaneous wellbore cooling and pressurization. This technique. if applied to the Phase II reservoir. would undoubtedly result in the formation of numerous incipient fractures along the entire EE-2 openhole section. This simple and straightforward method of developing a multiply-fractured HDR reservoir could have a profound influence on the cost of reservoir development, and the economics of the HDR concept in general. It is appropriate to remember that besides the HDR concept itself, Los Alamos developed the concept of openhole fracturing using inflatable packers, directional drilling in hot igneous roe k, and downhole seismic fracture detection: to name only some of the areas where we have proceeded the petroleum industry in developing new techniques to be applied to the often significantly different geothermal situation. 
Experiment 2003 – First Pressurization of EE-2\1982\Water was pumped into EE-J at a nominal rate of 9 qpm, to a final pressure of 2070 psi. The well bore was exceptionally tight - we might just have well pumped into a steel pressure vessel - not only was there - no evidence of breakdown, but only a total of about 30 gallons of water permeated the rock during the 2-1/2 hour-long pressurization. 
Experiment 2007: Kobe Pumping Into EE-3 at 9, 34, and 43 GPM\1982\In Expt. 2006, the EE-3 well bore exhibited an apparently extended zone of water-acceptance, extending for about 200 feet below the casing shoe. The large Kobe pump was sleeved for high pressure, which limited the flow rate to about 17 gpm at the peak obtainable injection pressure of about 1500 psi. It appears that this maximum injection pressure is still below the minimum earth stress (s 3 ) at this depth ( ~ 10,100 ft TVD) in EE-3, and higher flow rates will be necessary in order to measure s 3 . Some doubts were expressed about the interpretation of the flowing temperature log in Expt. 2006, so a set of recovery temperature logs is planned for this experiment, to confirm or deny the previous results. By resleeving the large Kobe pump, a pumping rate of 34 gpm can be achieved, and this can be combined with the small Kobe pump to attain 43 gpm. Seismic Signals Good seismic signals were detected on Expt. 2006, and a similar capability is desired for this experiment. 
Experiment 2008 – A Two Station Re-Measurement of the Geometry of the EE-3 Near Casing Fracture\1982\Analysis of the accelerometer system response to 11 microseismic events created in Experiment 2007 indicates that they are located in an ellipsoidal volume whose major axis direction is N 48� E and dips 47� to the SW. The intermediate axis is essentially horizontal and whose direction N 42� Wis the strike of the plane containing the two major axes. The dimensions of the three axes are 315, 10n and ~5 m respectively. The relationship of this seismic feature to the downhole wellbore map is shown in Figures J and 2. It will be noted that the ellipsoid is tangent to the injection point in EE-3 and descends at a 45� angle. The plan view shown in Figure 1 indicates that the zone of seismic activity nearly cut the EE-2 wellbore at a depth of 11500 ft (TVD). Examination of the EE-2 wellbore geology and drilling history shows a well defined zone from 11450 - 11550 ft TVD with a very fast drilling rate (30 ft/hr) and extensive alteration. Laney labels it as a fault zone. This then could be an unpressurized part of the planar feature described above. 
Experiment 2033: Proposed Injection Test into the Upper Fracture Zone in EE-3\1982\Detailed examination of microseismic event locations obtained from Experiments 2018, 2020, 2023 and 2025 suggest that the major difference in pressure behavior between systems that open at lower pressure and those that open at higher pressure can be ascribed to a lithologic boundary. The boundary appears to be defined by a discontinuity in joint orientation rather than an abrupt change in the stress field. Examination of rock types determined from cuttings in EE-2 and EE-3 have defined two major intrusive events whose contact roughly coincides with the inferred fracture orientation boundary. Some seismic evidence from Experiment 2020 indicates that this boundary can be broached from the high pressure side. However, there has not been sufficient fluid pumped into the fractures on the low pressure side (Expt. 2023) to determine whether or not a breakthrough at low pressure is possible. 
Fracture Evaluation Procedures\1982\Following fracturing it will be necessary to evaluate the success of each treatment. The primary method will be to measure impedance. In the Phase I reservoir this was routinely done within a day or two, but in the Phase II reservoir we may have to exert back pressure to avoid flashing, (for example at 275�C (527�F) the saturation pressure is 850 psia), and this back pressure may distort the results. The impedance test will be performed at injection flow rates which are adjusted so that injection pressures are just below the fracturing pressure. For initial estimates, we suggest 1400 psi as the maximum EE-2 wellhead pressure. During the early portion of the test the heat loss from the produced water to the rock surrounding EE-3 will be sufficient that the EE-3 wellhead pressure can be modest, say 200 psi or less (corresponding to 194�C or 380�F). but it may be necessary to start imposing higher back pressure for lonq-time, high flow rate tests. The flow rates during an impedance test will vary with fracture impedance; for rough estimation purposes, if the impedance is 5 psigpm the flow rate will be about 30 qpm, 15 psi/gpm yields 100 qpm, and 5 psi/gpm yields 300 gpm. During these impedance tests it will also be necessary to run temperature and spinner surveys. Typically background temperature survey will be required before flowing, and two flowing surveys will be required. To avoid wear and exposure of the cable it would be very desirable to rig up the spinner/temperature tool so that both signals, flow rate and temperature, can be read during a single survey. 
Fracturing Experiment 2016\1982\Experiment 2016 was conducted on June 20 and 21, 1982. This experiment represented our third attempt at a fracture connection between the bottom of hole EE-2, and the openhole section of EE-3. The initial fractures formed in the 450-foot-long openhole interval below the cemented-in liner in EE-2 were first extended during the 130,000 gallon injection of Experiment 2011. Following a 5-day intervening vent period, further pumping during Experiment 2012 -- 800,000 gallons of total injected flow -extended the seismic fracture zone to the region of EE-3, but without any indication of fracture breakthrough. The primary objective of Expt. 2016 was to hydraulically connect holes EE-2 and EE-3, utilizing a greater amount of injected fluid -- 1.3 million gallons were pumped into EE-2 -- and somewhat higher injection rates up to 35 BPM (as compared to 30 BPM during Expt. 2012). Despite this large volume of injected water, we failed to achieve hydraulic communication with EE-3. 
Hot-dry-rock geothermal resource 1980\1982\The work performed on hot dry rock (HDR) geothermal resource evaluation, site characterization, and geophysical exploration techniques is summarized. The work was done by region (Far West, Pacific Northwest, Southwest, Rocky Mountain States, Midcontinent, and Eastern) and limited to the conterminous US.
Orientation of least-principal horizontal stress: Arizona, New Mexico, and the Trans-Pecos area of west Texas: stress data and references\1982\This map is one of a series designed for hot dry rock geothermal assessment in Arizona, New Mexico, and the Trans-Pecos area of west Texas. It is intended to be used for predicting the orientations of hydrofractures that might form during future HDR energy operations. Indicators of principal stress orientation include alignments of young volcanic vents, trends of young dikes, slickensides on oblique-slip normal faults, earthquake focal mechanism solutions, hydrofracture orientations, and strain relief determinations. Stress provinces were delineated using the stress data in conjunction with geologic maps of the region. The Basin and Range stress province is characterized by least-principal horizontal stresses that are generally oriented west to west-northwest approximately perpendicular to the north-trending ranges. In southwestern Arizona, where the ranges and basins trend northwest, the least-principal horizontal stress directions are mostly oriented east-northeast. This segment of the Basin and Range Province is therefore shown as a subprovince (Sonoran). The Transitional Province, which wraps around the south edge of the Colorado Plateau, has stress orientations characteristic of both the Colorado Plateau and Basin and Range stress provinces.
Planning and drilling geothermal energy extraction hole EE-2: a precisely oriented and deviated hole in hot granitic rock\1982\During the preceding work (Phase I) of the Hot Dry Rock (HDR) Geothermal Energy Project at Fenton Hill, two holes were drilled to a depth of nearly 3048 m (10,000 ft) and connected by a vertical hydraulic fracture. In this phase, water was pumped through the underground reservoir for approximately 417 days, producing an energy equivalent of 3 to 5 MW(t). Energy Extraction Hole No. 2 (EE-2) is the first of two deep holes that will be used in the Engineering-Resource Development System (Phase II) of the ongoing HDR Project of the Los Alamos National Laboratory. This phase of the work consists of drilling two parallel boreholes, inclined in their lower, open-hole sections at 35/sup 0/ to the vertical and separated by a vertical distance of 366 m (1200 ft) between the inclined parts of the drill holes. The holes will be connected by a series of vertical, hydraulically produced fractures in the Precambrian granitic rock complex. EE-2 was drilled to a depth of 4660 m (15,289 ft), where the bottom-hole temperature is approximately 320/sup 0/C (608/sup 0/F). Directional drilling techniques were used to control the azimuth and deviation of the hole. Upgrading of the temperature capability of existing hardware, and development of new equipment was necessary to complete the drilling of the hole in the extremely hot, hard, and abrasive granitic formation. The drilling history and the problems with bits, directional tools, tubular goods, cementing, and logging are described. A discussion of the problems and recommendations for overcoming them are also presented.
Polynomial Fits to EE-2 and EE-3 Temperature Data\1982\"Several people have expressed interest in having simple equations that describe ""original"" temperature conditions in EE-2 and EE-3. Polynomials were fit to the most recent EE-2 (1-05-82) and EE-3 (1-19-82) background temperature logs using a least squares technique. For both wellbores the data were divided into two parts, from 0-2450 feet and 2450 feet to TD, and fit with appropriate polynomials. The upper portions (0-2450 feet) were easily fit with first order (linear) polynomials, while the lower intervals (2450 feet-TD) were matched with second order polynomials. The resulting equations for the two wells were amazingly similar and ""averaged"" polynomials fit the data for both EE-2 and EE-3 fairly well. The polynomials are tabulated below and curves showing the actual temperature logs plus the polynomial fits are attached. All depths used in this analysis were corrected Log Cable Depths. "
Quarterly Progress Report, October-December 1981\1982\Considerable effort was directed towards a re-evaluation of the least principal earth stress in the Phase I reservoir. From this work, a new and essentially unique method of determining the minimum earth stress from injection flow testing was developed. The resulting value for s was then tested against porous media elastic theory, resulting in an 3 indicated Poisson 1s ratio of 0.24, a value in substantial agreement with both in-situ dynamic measurements within and above the Phase I reservoir, and with numerous laboratory measurements on core samples. This injection flow method of earth stress determination was then applied to those pumping tests involving wellbore intervals with intersecting S? -rather than s3 -- joints. From these analyses, an s2 value approximately 1000 psi greater than S was determined at a depth oi 2700 m. These derived S? values were then tested against the Phase I reservoir flowthrough data for Run Segments 2,3,4 and 5. An agreement between these reservoir flow-through-derived s2 values and the above injection-derived s2 levels of better than 4 bars (<1%) was obtained. 
Quartz dissolution and silica deposition in hot-dry-rock geothermal systems\1982\The kinetics of quartz dissolution control the produced fluid dissolved silica concentration in geothermal systems in which the downhole residence time is finite. The produced fluid of the Phase I, Run Segment 5 experimental Hot Dry Rock (HDR) geothermal system at Fenton Hill, NM, was undersaturated with respect to quartz in one pass through the reservoir, suggesting that the rate of granite dissolution governed the outlet dissolved silica concentration in this system. The literature data for the rate of quartz dissolution in water from 65 to 625/sup 0/C is correlated using an empirical rate law which is first order in quartz surface area and degree of undersaturation of the fluid. The Arrhenius plot (ln k vs T/sup -1/) is linear over eight orders of magnitude of the rate constant, verifying the validity of the proposed rate expression. Carefully performed quartz dissolution experiments in the present study duplicated the literature data and completed the data base in the temperature range from 150 to 250/sup 0/C. Identical experiments using crushed granite indicate that the rate of quartz dissolution in the presence of granite could be as much as 1 to 2 orders of magnitude faster than the rates observed in the pure quartz experiments. A temperature dependent HDR reservoir model incorporates the quartz dissolution rate law to simulate the dissolved silica behavior during the Fenton Hill Run Segment 5 experiment. For this low-permeability, fracture-dominated reservoir, the assumptions of one-dimensional plug flow through a vertically-inclined rectangular fracture and one-dimensional rock heat conduction perpendicular to the direction of flow are employed. These simplifications lead to an analytical solution for the temperature field in the reservoir.
Reservoir Modeling Using Chemically Reactive Tracers\1982\This memo lays out a theoretical basis for geothermal reservoir modeling using chemically reactive tracers. First, the concept of utilizing the temperature dependent kinetics of a chemical reaction to measure thermal drawdown is demonstrated using a simplified plug flow reservoir model. Then, an analysis of the transient behavior of a chemically reactive tracer experiment will show how these diagnostic tests may be used to determine a more reliable reservoir model than we are able to achieve with our current methods. 
Three Hypotheses on the Principal Stress Directions in the Fenton Hill Phase II Reservoir\1982\We owe new information on the state of stress around the EE-2 and EE-3 openhole sections to Fred Homuth and Dan Cash: a preliminary fault-plane solution of earthquakes triggered after our June 04, 1982 pumping shows clear evidence of a strike slip mechanism. This does not match any of the previous conceptions of the subsurface stress field. 
A history of hot dry rock geothermal energy systems\1983\This is a short history, so far as it can now be assembled, of early speculations and observations concerning the existence and origin of natural heat in the earth's crust; of some of the many methods proposed to extract and use it; and of recent investigations designed to develop and demonstrate such methods. It is probably only the preface to a much longer history—still to be written—of mankind's beneficial use of this, one of earth's oldest, most plentiful, most widespread and secure energy sources.
Current Summary of Hydraulic Fracturing Experiments in Phase II Reservoir\1983\To aid those interested in wading through the old experimental data regarding Phase II fracturing, we have compiled the following summary of the experiments. A similar summary, but one slanted from a surface operations viewpoint, was reported by A. Richard Sinclair in reference 1. Our summary is abstracted from the individual experiment - reports, when available, the daily status reports, and other available information. Whenever possible we have tried to acknowledge individual authors, but occasionally we may have been incomplete in our attribution, and in these cases we offer our apologies. In the near future we intend to compile temperature and friction-corrected downhole pressures so that a complete categorization of fracture pressures will be available. 
Experiment 2011, the First Pump with the PBR (May 30, 1982)\1983\Experiment 2011 was the first fracturing attempt in EE-3 through the 3-1/2 drill pipe, with the PBR in place. The initial plan to inject 1 M gallons was not realized due to mechanical problems. The pressure and flowrates in the wellbore and annulus respectively during the experiment are given in Figures 1 and 2 (thanks to Japanese colleagues). Figure 3 shows calculated wellbore temperature. The major events are listed below and were taken from the workover operations daily report. 
Experiment 2018, First Fracturing Attempt Below Casing Shoe in EE-2 (1982-7-19/20)\1983\The purpose of Experiment 2018 was to achieve a hydraulic connection between EE-2 and EE-3 in the region just below their respective casing shoes. To protect the casing of EE-2, the fracturing fluid had to be pumped down a 3-1/2 inch drill string to an Otis casing packer set 240 ft above the casing shoe of EE-2. Pumping started at 16:23 of July 19, 1982,and was terminated at 2:02 on July 20, 1982, due to hardware failure, after some trouble with the setting of the casing packer had delayed the beginning of the experiment for approximately two days. Prior to the experiment, a sand plug in EE-2 had been set, with its top (all depths referenced here are cable depths). A total of  been pumped. No hydraulic connection appeared at the end of Experiment 2018. 
Experiment 2028: Flowing Temperature Logs and Evaluation of Wellbore Heat Transfer Coefficients with the Nitrogen Blankets – Revision I\1983\The accurate . assessment of temperatures in the casing and liner is . critical to the safety of EE-3 during the upcoming fracturing experiment. The purpose of this experiment is to obtain heat transfer coefficients for the nitrogen filled annulus as well as the water filled annulus �below the nitrogen water interface. In addition the flowing temperature logs that were not obtained during Experiment 2026 because of an obstruction; will now be obtained in this experiment. 
Experiment 2030: EE-2 Temperature Log and Downhole Water Sample\1983\A temperature log and downhole water sample run were conducted in EE-2 on July 13, 1983. The temperature log wis taken to show any changes which had occurred in the fracture-to-well bore intersections as a result of the Experiment 2020 pumping and to locate fluid entries for taking the water sample. The water sample was requested primarily to determine the arsenic concentration in EE-2 fluids ( see mano from C. Grigsby, June 28, 1983 concerning arsenic in EE-3 samples.) The temperature log was run using the thermistor in the ESS-6 water samples. 
Experiment 2032 – Surface Instrumentation\1983\Surface instrumentation for Experiment 2032 was set up to record pressure, temperature, and flow in three primary areas, namely, the EE-2 wellhead fluid- injection, EE-3 wellhead, and the vent system through the liquid/gas separator. The EE-2 injection instrumentation included wellhead pressure, backside pressure, fluid injection temperature, and fluid injection flow. Injection pressure was measured using two Dynisco strain-gage 0-10,000-psi transducers. The transducer was mounted on each of the Dowell injection lines going to the EE-2 wellhead from the two flow injection missiles. The transducers were mounted in a pressure housing wrapped with heat tape to avoid freezing and possible blowout of the gage. A Precise Sensor strain-gage 0-5000-psi transducer was mounted on the EE-2 wellhead backside or annulus between the 5-1 /2-in. frac-string and the 9-5/8-in. casing. This transducer was also protected from freezing and blowout. A RdF RTD 0-100�C temperature sensor measured the injection fluid temperature. 
Experiment 2033: Injection Test of Upper EE-3 Fracture Zone\1983\This experiment is designed to investigate the apparent lithologic boundary between the low-opening-pressure fracture system (upper EE-3 fracture and Phase I system) and the high-opening-pressure fracture system (lower fractures in EE-3 and in EE-2). The experiment will test for resistance to breakthrough into the lower EE-2 fracture system at relatively low pressure and will define the venting behavior of the low pressure system. Further objectives of this experiment include testing of existing elements of the preCambrian net, determining the operational lifetime of a triaxial geophone, testing the slim-line detonator package and attempting to calibrate the preCambrian net with two string shots. The microseismic coverage for this pump test will consist of two deep 3-axi s geophone tools -- one in EE-1 and the other in EE-2 ( through the pressure lock and packoff), the preCambrian (pG) net, and a 4-station surface net. The pG station in the GRI hole is being eliminated to allow us to deploy the second large 3-axis geophone tool deep in EE-2, within the upper Phase II reservoir region. 
Experiment 2034: The Evaluation of Heat Transfer in the Foam-Filled EE-3 Annulus\1983\The purpose of Experiment 2034, conducted October 20, 1983, was to measure the heat transfer coefficient in a foam filled annulus. Previous experiments with using nitrogen gas in the annulus resulted in transfer coefficients high enough that heating of the injected water would be required if fracturing were ever to be resumed in EE-3. Theoretically, the foam, by virtue of its increased viscosity would limit the natural convection in the annulus and could be as much as 10 times better as an insulator. The foam was provided and injected by Dowell. Don Dreesen and Bob Nicholson corrected Dowell's original design so that at operating pressure and temperature the foam would be 75% quality, i.e., 75% of the volume would be occupied by low thermal conductivity nitrogen gas, and the remaining 25% of the volume would be occupied by gelled water. 
Experiment 2035: Investigation of the EE-2 Casing Shoe and Openhole Interval\1983\Determine the amount and distribution of the postulated flow behind the EE-2 casing. 2. Determine the flow split between the several openhole fracture entrances. Equipment Required 1. Dowell pumper capable of injecting up to 3 BPM at 2000 psi 2. ESS-6 logging van with Spinner/temperature tool 3. Wireline packoff and pressure lock 4. Commercial wireline tracer-injector/gamma service (OWP) Instrumentation 1. Injection flow rate and pressure by Dowell 2. Injection pressure by ESS-6 (0-2500 psi) 3. Downhole wireline temperature and spinner recordings. Procedure - Note all logs conducted at 100 feet per minute. 
Experimental Heat Transfer Coefficients with the Nitrogen Blanket (Experiment 2028) and Modeling of the 1.5 M Gallon Pump in EE-3\1983\The experimental determination of the nitrogen blanket heat transfer coefficient was a great success. Analysis of the data lead to the discovery cc. two rather subtle input errors in the code WBHT. These errors involved using wrong mean areas to evaluate the thermal resistance and using two-sided resistances instead of a singlesided one across the void (annulus) space. The results could be modeled using a nitrogen blanket heat transfer coefficient of between 15-20 W (because of the mentioned input m2oc error, the preliminary runs were made with a heat transfer coefficient of w 1. 6 ---). The literature gives a maximum coefficient of about; however, the data was limited to low mean temperatures m �C (100�F). In the experiment the temperature differences were several times the literature values and the mean temperature was about twice the literature value. These larger temperature values would result in more free convection and thus a larger heat transfer coefficient. With application to the 1.5 M gallon pump the new results indicate an average temperature drop in the casing of 18�C. This is over the established redline of 15�C. 
Further Results on Heat Transfer Coefficients for the EE-3 Nitrogen Blanket Experiment\1983\In previous memos on the heat transfer coefficient in the nitrogen filled annulus in EE-3, it was reported that the measured results were higher than theoretically estimated values by a factor of 2-3; measured value lying between 20-25 W/rn20 c. The estimated values previously used were based upon natural (buoyant) convection heat transfer correlations involving Nusselt and Grashof numbers. In evaluating the latter we incorrectly evaluated the kinematic viscosity of nitrogen. Now, using pressure corrections for kinematic viscosity values we obtain theoretically estimated values between 20 and 70 W/(m20 c). The measured values agree with the lower end of this range. To put these values in perspective, it is noted that if the annulus was filled with water instead of nitrogen, the heat transfer coefficient would be seven times higher. However, before readers conclude that nitrogen results in a system seven times as insulative, we point out that the heat transfer system is complex - heat is transferred from rock to casing, through the annulus to the drill pipe, and then to the flowing water in the drill pipe. At each interface there are contact or fluid film heat transfer resistances, and distributed resistances over the casing and pipe wall thicknesses as well as resistance in the rock itself. This latter resistance increases with time as the thermal boundary layer penetrates deeper into the rock. 
Gas Analysis of Core Samples from Fenton Hill\1983\Among the suggested sources of the CO2 produced by the deep wells at Fenton Hill are secondary fluid inclusions produced during formation of the magma chamber related to the Valles event (1.1 m.y.). If this hypothesis were correct, the number of fluid inclusions and the amount of CO2 in them should increase with depth in the well bore, particularly since EE-2 was deviated toward the caldera. Twenty core samples and two surface gneiss samples from Guadalupe Box were decrepitated to open these inclusions and the gases analyzed by mass spectrometry by MIDECO of Salt Lake City. Whole rock or core samples were crushed to -60+200 mesh and heated rapidly to 375�C to break the inclusions. Results of the analyses for CO2 and S02 are given in Table 1 and are plotted vs. depth in Figures 1 and 2. As can be seen in the two figures, there appears to be considerable scatter in the data. Some of this scatter probably reflects the relative modal abundance of quartz (which contains most of the inclusions) in the samples. A better analytical method would be to separate quartz from each sample and only decrepitate this single mineral, instead of the crushed whole rock. This was not done because of the difficulty of separating quartz from plagioclase of the same density. Despite the scatter in the data, there is clearly no increase with depth of either CO2 or S02 in fluid inclusions. CO2 decreases gradually below 11739 feet. S02 decreases abruptly from 8578 feet to 9607 feet and then remains generally low. It seems likely that the high temperatures in the deeper Precambrian section have resulted in closure of any fluid inclusions present. Other sources of the CO2 should be sought. 
Geology of the Fenton Hill, New Mexico, hot dry rock site\1983\The Phase I prototype hot dry rock (HDR) geothermal system was developed in Precambrian basement rocks at Fenton Hill, New Mexico. Core and cuttings samples from the four deep wells indicate that the reservoir of this Phase I HDR system lies within a homogeneous biotite granodiorite body of very low permeability. Natural fractures, although present, are typically sealed with secondary minerals. The biotite granodiorite is intrusive into a heterogeneous metamorphic complex comprised of gneisses of variable composition and minor mafic schist, amphibolite, and metavolcanic rocks. The deeper part of this metamorphic section is the site of a deeper Phase II system currently under development. Differences in geology between the phase I and underlying Phase II systems will provide an opportunity for further testing of HDR development techniques.
Hot dry rock geothermal energy development program. Annual report, fiscal year 1982\1983\Emphasis in the Hot Dry Rock Program was on development of methods to produce the hydraulic fractures required to connect the deep, inclined wells of the Phase II system at Fenton Hill. Environmental surveillance, instrument development, laboratory and modeling studies, and other supporting activities were continued. After two unsuccessful attempts to fracture hydraulically through inflatable packers, formation breakdown was produced in an uncased section near the bottom of well EE-2 by pumping water through a cemented-in steel liner. Breakdon occurred at a wellhead pressure of 33.1 MPa and a total of 8539 m/sup 3/ of water was injected. Mapping of source locations of microseismic events indicated opening of an extensive set of planar features dipping about 40/sup 0/W, striking about N20/sup 0/W, and apparently passing beneath the bottom of well EE-3. An attempt was then made to fracture at a higher level where the relative positions of the two wells increased the probability that an inclined fracture would connect them. Repeated failures of drill pipe, tubing, couplings, and packers terminated most pumping experiments prematurely. Important advances were made in thermal protection of downhole instruments, real-time mapping source locations of microseismic signals, modeling of heat and mass transport, and the mechanics of hydraulic fracturing.
Hot dry rock geothermal energy in the Jemez volcanic field, New Mexico\1983\Nearly all high temperature geothermal systems are associated with young volcanic fields. The most efficient means of transferring heat into the upper crust is through the generation and rise of magma. With this in mind, Smith and Shaw (1975, 1979) evaluated the magnitude of thermal energy associated with the young igneous systems of the United States and found the total heat within these systems was estimated to be about 100,000 x 1018J (100,000 Quads l. They did not, however, determine the relative magnitudes of heat available with the volcanic fields as hydrothermal systems and as hot dry rock (HOR), although they estimated that half of the energy was still stored in magma. Brook and co-workers (1979) did estimate the moderate to high temperature hydrothermal resources (those >90�C) within the same volcanic fields. By comparing the Brook et al. data with those of Smith and Shaw it became apparent that the thermal energy within these systems that may be extracted as a hydrothermal resource ranges from 1.5 per cent to about 10 per cent of the total energy present to a depth of 10 km. If the heat remaining is to be used it must be extracted through the use of manmade systems such as forced geoheat recovery (Bodvarsson, 1976, and this volume; White, this volume) or hot dry rock (HOR) . The purpose of this paper is to examine what we know about a well-described igneous system associated with a large caldera to see if there is some basis for determining the distribution and approximate ratio of hydrothermal and HOR resource bases within such a system. 
More on Downward Growth of Hydraulic Shear Fractures\1983\"The friction coefficient on the shear fractures is an important parameter for determining if downward growth occurs. Estimates of friction coefficient for Fenton Hill and for the British site at Rosemanowes are made. At Fenton Hill the maximum value one may expect is about 42� {?f ""'().9) and at Rosemanowes 35� may be appropriate. These are considerably lower than some of the values currently assumed, they put Rosemanowes clearly in a downward growth regime. Fenton Hill must be very close to the critical conditions, with upward or downward growth determined by the geometry of the joint in question. "
Packer Test Calculations for Experiment 2032 Pre-Pump\1983\In order to rapidly determine that the upper OTIS packer, 5-1/2 inch tubing 9-5/8 inch casing and wellhead assembly form a competent pressure vessel, calculations have been run to predict backside performance during the pre-pump. Using the flow rate history (Attachment #1) and average annulus temperature (Attachment #2), the mass of water required to maintain an annular volume of 523.5 bbls at 2000 psi surface pressure was calculated. Two methods were used to calculate the mass. The assumptions made to do these calculations are summarized in Table I. Mass was determined using the average density method as outlined: 
Proposed Injection into “Thief” Zone in EE-3\1983\The experiment consists of pumping 150-200K gallons of heated water (ri70 �C) at a nominal flow rate of 10 bpm into the EE-3 wellhead. We would look for fracture opening pressures as well as evidence for boundaries to the system (indicated by a rise in press_u.re for a constant flow) or evidence of the 11 infinitely 11 permeable fault. Seismic monitoring consisting of the downhole triaxial geophone in EE-1 and the pre-preCambrian net {GT-1, GR!, GT-2) would be important in determining the growth directions of the system. A bromine tracer test would delineate the flow fractions in each fracture and could provide information about the connectivity of the fractures. 
Results of Experiment 2035, Preliminary Analysis\1983\The purpose of this experiment was to run temperature, spinner and tracer surveys in EE-2, while injecting water, so as to determine the extent, if any, of damage to the casing cement, and also to determine locations and flow fractions of the fractures between the bottom of the casing and the top of the sand. Based upon analysis of background, flowing and shut-in surveys we conclude that the EE-2 casing cement is still in good condition. At wellhead pressures of 2-000 psi or less, we cannot detect, within the limit of our resolution ( 5 to 10%) any flow behind the casing. We determined that water enters the formation below the casing shoe at 2 major locations. The first, accounting for 50% of the flow, occurs at the ESS-6 cable depth of about 11,600 feet, and the second, accounting for 35% of the flow, occurs at 11,880 feet. The remaining 15% of the flow continues down the well, past the lowest depth surveyed. Because of the desirability of running two surveys concurrently, temperature and spinner, we did not have a collar locator on the tool, thus the cable depths reported here cannot be rigorously defined with respect to the -casing shoe. A sudden oscillation of the spinner suggests the shoe occurs at 11,510 feet, but previous surveys (with different cables) suggest the shoe is at 11,580 feet. Consequently the first major fracture entry, with soi of the flow, is 20 to 90 feet below the shoe, and the second fracture entry is 300 to 370 feet below the shoe. 
Results of Temperature and Collar Surveys in EE-2 – November 16-17, 1983\1983\The purpose of these surveys was to remove the ambiguities in fracture locations from the Experiment 2035 surveys which were run the previous week without a collar locator. It was confirmed that a major fracture, taking about soi of the injected water, exists right at, or within 10 to 20 feet below, the casing shoe. Another large fracture, taking about 30% of the flow, occurs at 11,900 feet, 320 feet below the shoe. During these surveys we detected small, about O.6�C, anomalies in the background and shut-in temperature surveys. These anomalies correspond to a possible casing leak 76 feet above the shoe, and are well correlated with kicks in OWP and ESS-6 collar locator logs. This leak location also corresponds, with uncertainties, to a spinner kick during the November 10-11, 1983 survey, and the scraper hang-up on November 14, 1983. 
Simulation of Downhole Pressures for EE-2 and EE-3 Hydraulic Fracturing Experiments\1983\The WBHT Code was used to model EE-2 and EE-3 pumping experiments (see Table 1 Summary of Hydraulic Fracturing Experiments, in memo ESS-4-83- 80) to simulate downhole pressures. In all cases it was assumed the wells were at original geothermal gradient conditions prior to pumping. For cases where friction reducer was added to the injected water, it was assumed friction pressure losses were reduced by 2/3. Friction reducer was generally added when pumping rates exceeded about 10 BPM. Figures 1 - 24 present the results of this modeling. 
The Failure of a High Pressure Line During Experiment 2032: A Preliminary Report\1983\"At 051 O on December 9, 1983 a flange attached to the wellhead of EE-2 broke ending experiment 2032 after 5.7 million gallons of water had been pumped into EE-2 in an attempt to fracture into EE-3. By about 0512 Dowell had stopped pumping and the wellhead valves were closed shutting in the 5 1/2 inch frac. string. Immediately after the flange broke at 0510, the pressure in the 5 1/2"" x 9 5/8"" annulus began to increase and after the wellhead valves were closed the annulus pressure began to rise even more rapidly. This increase of backside pressure can be explained by the rapid heating of annular fluid during the vent back of the tubing. The backside pumper should have maintained the annulus at 2,000 psi by venting, but this was impossible since the pumper was in the line of the spray from the failed frac line. The experimental plan called for the backside truck to be placed 120 (plus) feet from EE-2. The pumper was placed next to the rig about 40 feet from the frac. head. At about 0514 the pressure relief disk in the annul us vent line burst. The disk was designed to burst at 2,500 psi, but the pressure at the burst was 3,207 psi. The broken flange was replaced and a valve was attached. After closing this valve, the vent valves on the 5 1/2 inch tubing were opened to relieve the pressure. The volume of fluid venting from the 5 1 /2"" x 9 5/8"" annulus through the ruptured pressure relief disk was very moderate for a short time (thermal expansion?) and then increased rapidly (packer or casing failure?). As the hot water flowed from the formation up EE-2, heating the 5 1 /2 inch frac string it grew by thermal expansion out of the well. Because it was chained to the derrick, as it grew it was pulled to one side, bending the casing more and more as it grew. It was feared that the frac string might burst, so all personnel left the rig. As venting continued, the pressure in the frac. string and the annulus gradually decreased over a period of several days. "
Commercial Tracer Test in EE-2\1984\Earlier tracer tests run in the Phase I system proved useful in determining the geometry of the annular spaces behind casing (1). Based on this experience the following experiment will be run in the EE-2 wellbore in order to estimate the state of the 9-5/8-in. casing below 10,750 ft. 
Environmental studies conducted at the Fenton Hill Hot Dry Rock geothermal development site\1984\An environmental investigation of Hot Dry Rock (HDR) geothermal development was conducted at Fenton Hill, New Mexico, during 1976-1979. Activities at the Fenton Hill Site included an evaluation of baseline data for biotic and abiotic ecosystem components. Identification of contaminants produced by HDR processes that had the potential for reaching the surrounding environment is also discussed. Three dominant vegetative communities were identified in the vicinity of the site. These included grass-forb, aspen, and mixed conifer communities. The grass-forb area was identified as having the highest number of species encountered, with Phleum pratense and Dactylis glomerata being the dominant grass species. Frequency of occurrence and mean coverage values are also given for other species in the three main vegetative complexes. Live trapping of small mammals was conducted to determine species composition, densities, population, and diversity estimates for this component of the ecosystem. The data indicate that Peromyscus maniculatus was the dominant species across all trapping sites during the study. Comparisons of relative density of small mammals among the various trapping sites show the grass-forb vegetative community to have had the highest overall density. Comparisons of small mammal diversity for the three main vegetative complexes indicate that the aspen habitat had the highest diversity and the grass-forb habitat had the lowest. Analyses of waste waters from the closed circulation loop indicate that several trace contaminants (e.g., arsenic, cadmium, fluoride, boron, and lithium) were present at concentrations greater than those reported for surface waters of the region.
Events Immediately after Failure of Frac Head Companion Flange\1984\"Just after the male half of the C-1 companion flange failed. I looked out of the drill trailer immediately and saw the drill crew corning down the steps, out of the doghouse. I went to the dog house to see what the problem was, the discharge from the frac head was directed at the derrick leg between the doghouse and frac head. It was impossible to go onto the rig floor from the doghouse side. The toolpusher, Mike Driver and I went down the doghouse stairs, around the back of the rig and up the stairs on the toolshed side of the floor. The handle of the lower master valve was facing the draw-works. The upper master valve was facing the vee-door. The toolpusher and I closed the lower master valve (M-1) and then Mike Driver closed the upper master valve (M-2). I immediately asked for Joe Skalski's crew to look for a replacement flange for C-1. We could not find one. Just after leaving the floor I went to the backside rig manifold and observed that the well was venting. I became quite concerned about the 9-5/8"" and the packer. I went back to the floor and had the rig crew remove C-3 and install it where C-1 had been so that we could vent the frac string to relieve the differential measure across the packer. Formation (granite), cement and calcium carbonate was blown out the face string. Large chunks (2""x2"" x l"" blocks) of formation were impringing on the derrick leg while we were closing the M-1 and M-2 valves. "
Experiment 2032 Report\1984\Experiment 2032 was conducted in two stages. The first stage, the so-called pre-pump was an initial test of the packer installed at 3.46 km {11,340 feet) in the EE-2 well which was conducted on November 30, 1983. A total volume of 360m3 {95,000 gallons) was injected at pumping pressures up to 41 MPa (6000 psi). In the _2nd stage, December 6-9, about 21,000 m3 (5.6 million gallons) of water* were injected in well EE-2, at surface pumping pressures up to 48 MPa (7000 psi) and injection rates as high as 0.11 m3/sec (43 bpm) in an attempt to hydraulically fracture the rock between wells EE-2 and EE-3 to create a 1 ow impedance flow connection. Fourteen pumping units pl us additional standby pumpers were provided by the Dowell Company. The total Dowell cost was $886,000 for both experiment stages 
Experiment 2036: Phase VI – Radiobromine Tracer Examination of Packer Seal\1984\To determine if there is any flow past the Otis packer at an injection pressure level of about 2000 psi. Equipment 1. Rig pumps, plumbing and water supply. 2. Logging- wellhead--as for Phase IV. 3. Kobe pump (for tracer injection only). 4. ESS-6 logging van with gamma tool. 5. 30 mCi of NH4 82 Br in lead pig. Instrumentation 1. Injection pressure, 0-5000 psi (tubing side only; no backside pressure required). 2. DAT strip chart recording of above pressure (no HP computer output needed). 
Experiment 2036: Post-MHF Evaluation of EE-2\1984\During the emergency ventdown of EE-2 following the MHF phase of Expt. 2032, fluid was venting out the frac string (tubing), the backside, and the annulus between the 13-3/8-in and 9-5/8-in casing strings. The tubing and backside flows were a mixture of water and steam as a result of flashing across chokes, while the annulus flow appeared to be dry steam. 
Experiment 2037 Data\1984\The purpose of this experiment was to investigate possible fracture connections in EE-3 and their depths by flowing the well (by both venting and injection) while surveying temperatures. The ESS-6 slimline temperature and collar locator tool was used to survey inside the fracture string, through the patch, and then nearly to the bottom of the cemented-in liner. A sketch of the downhole configuration, provided by Don Dreesen, is presented in Figure 1. The experiment was conducted last night and this morning. In the interests of rapid dissemination the data is being made available now, nearly in raw form, rather than waiting for the further analysis which will be reported later. Major results are summarized in Table I and in the temperature surveys attached. Table I is a chronology which allows the temperature surveys to be keyed to time and the various flows in the well. 
Experiment 2038, Phase I\1984\In order to obtain travel time corrections for seismic waves traveling between microearthquake sources and seismic recording stations, it is necessary to perform a seismic calibration experiment using artificial sources (explosives) pl aced at known locations in the seismic source region. The goals of Experiment 2038 are: (1) to fully calibrate P and S travel times to all elements of the Precambrian and surface seismic networks as they were set up for Experiment 2032. ( 2) Obtain enough redundant calibration data to assess the effects of travel time anomalies along different travel paths to calculated locations of events. (3) Check for the consistency of the 'Fudge Factors I used in the hodogram location technique by using sources from a variety of locations to calculate 'Fudge Factors'. (4) Obtain a better understanding of the accuracy of microseismic locations calculated using the hodogram, two tool hodogram, and Precambrian network schemes. Due to limitations of in-house availability of explosives and the probability that .EE-3 will soon be placed in a configuration where access by the geophone package to the location it occupied during Expt. 2032 will not be possible, Experiment 2038 will be run in two phases. Phase I, discussed here, will involve firing detonator shots only to instruments located in EE-3 and EE-1. Phase II will consist of larger shots fired to all Precambrian and surface seismic array elements except EE-3. Due to the split nature of this experiment, it will be imperative that shot locations be known as precisely as possible during both phases of the experiment and that the location of the EE-1 sensor package be placed as closely as possible to the same location for each phase of the experiment. 
Experiment 2039 – Diagnostic Logging in EE-3\1984\"Experiment 2039, diagnostic logging in EE-3, was conducted in two parts: Part A, temperature and collar locator surveys while injecting water was run from ""'16:00, 4-Apr-84 through ... 11:00, 5-Apr-84. Part B, tracer surveys, run from ""'8:15 - 21:00, 6-Apr-84. The purpose of these surveys was to determine fluid entry locations in the open hole sections of EE-3. Figure 1 portrays the downhole geometry in EE-3 at the time of this experiment. The ""patch"" at 10,900 feet, which was intended to provide pressure continuity from the tubing run in from the surface to the cemented-in liner, was known to be leaking badly, so unless the tubing was adequately shut-in while injecting down the annulus between the tubing and the casing, the injected flow could flow down to the patch, leak through it, and ret urn to the surface via the tubing. Difficulties in ensuring adequate shut-in of the tubing are discussed below. "
Experiment 2039 – Revision 2\1984\In a previous experiment procedure, Experiment 2039 was proposed as a complicated experiment involving geophone calibrations with detonators, diagnostic temperature and tracer logging in EE-3, and finally an injection of 500,000 gallons. The expected downhole configuration is shown in Figure 1. The Bowen patch will mate to, but will not make a seal with, the top (or stub) of the cemented-in liner. The 4-1/2 inch VAM tubing will be run from the surface to the PBR at 10,200 feet. The starting date of this experiment is estimated to be March 20, but this is subject to several days slippage, and the experiment may require 2 or 3 days to complete. 
Experiment 2039: Procedure for Tracer Surveys in EE-3 (Reference: ESS-4/84/87 “Experiment 2039 – Revision 2” 3/13/84)\1984\"This memorandum is intended to provide a more specific procedure for the gamma tracer surveys of the upper openhole region of EE-3 (between the casing shoe and the cemented-in liner), during that phase of Expt. 2039. This procedure supersedes the brief paragraph provided in the above-referenced memorandum. If any additional gamma logging is necessary beyond that outlined below, a two day break in operations will be necessary to obtain more radio-bromine and to develop an additional procedure. It is here assumed that the EE-3 wellhead is fitted with an isolation valve(s) and a Bowen wireline packoff, but without a pressure lock. To verify and quantify the flow split between the upper (Potter ""thief zone 11 ) fracture entrances, and the lower (Murphy zone) fracture entrance, as identified during the previous temperature-logging. "
Experiment 2042\1984\"Experiment 2042, an injection test in EE-3, was conducted from May 15, 1984 through May 19, 1984. During this four day test ~2 million gallons of water were injected with a maximum injection rate of -IOBPM at 6000 psi. It was planned as r1 pumping test of the lower zone of well EE-3 (the open hole region from 11,400 ft to 11,648 ft) to test the reservoir characteristics and fracture-seismic system first created during Experiment 2025. However early in the experiment it became apparent that there was some sort of connection between the lower zone and the upper ""low pressure"" zone in EE-3 (from the casing shoe at 10374 ft to about 10900 ft). Available information ruled out a packer failure or other direct connection between these zones so the experiment was continued as planned. Although not a major goal of the experiment, it was hoped that fractures would propagr1te from EE-3 to EE-2, so hydraulic communication could be established between the wells, however this did not occur. "
Experiment 2042 High-Pressure Injection: EE-3 (Reference: ESS-4/84/149 Revised)\1984\To connect the lower openhole section of EE-3 to the large surrounding fracture system formed during the EE-2 MHF test. With the help of the seismologists, test each surface seismic station to ensure operation. b. Plumb in Dowell to the EE-3 wellhead. 2 Plumb in and test water supply system. 2. Run in and position the large geophone packages in EE-1 and GT-2. 3. EE-1 Geophone Calibration: a. Using 5.6 gm augmented dets, run in EE-2 with the detonator tool to a depth of 10,300 feet and fire both dets. b. Depending on the results of a. above, repeat the det shots once more. c. Remove the detonator tool from EE-2. 4. Run in EE-2 with the modified slim-line geophone tool, and park at 11,300 feet. 5. Preliminary Pumping Operations* a. At a pumping rate of 1 8PM, pressurize EE-3 to 4000 psi and shut in. b. Using both Kobe pumps, start pumping down the backside of EE-3 on a continuous basis. The pressure should rise to about 1000 to 1100 psi. c. When the backside pressure reaches 800 psi, resume pumping down the EE-3 tubing at 1 8PM. Continue pumping at this rate for one hour. d. Increase the pumping rate to 3 8PM and maintain for one hour. e. Further increase the pumping rate to 5 8PM and maintain for one hour. 6. High-Pressure Pumping Phase a. Increase the pumping rate until the surface injection pressure reaches 6000 psi: the maximum allowable pressure for this experiment. The pumping rate corresponding to a maximum injection pressure of 6000 psi will range from 9 to 12 8PM. b. Continue pumping until up to 2 million gallons have been injected into EE-2. At 10 8PM, this will take about 3 1/2 days. 
Experiment 2042: High-Pressure Injection Below the Liner in EE-3\1984\"To test fracture-seismic system and characteristics in the region below the 4-1/2-in. cemented-in liner of EE-3 (i.e., open hole region from 11,400 to 11,648 ft depth approximately) which in previous experiments has shown a ""break-down"" pressure of above 4500 psi. An alternate objective will be to pump into the open hole region above the liner (10,300 to 10,900 ft) should the down hole seals (hardware) not permit attainment of the first objective. "
Experiment 2043\1984\Early during Experiment 2042, flow communication was established between the high-pressure injection interval below the liner in EE-3, and the low-pressure fracture zone between the casing and the liner (the latter region being open to the annulus.) As Experiment 2042 progressed, it became apparent that this flow connection was not via a packer leak or a direct bypass around the cemented-in liner. This was inferred from the very slow pressure equilibration behavior of the flow connection under shut-in conditions, implying that the communication was through a relatively high impedance flow path more typical of a fracture connection or connections. Several subsequent short-duration Kobe pumping tests ( on 5/24/84 and 5/29/84) indicated that this flow connection had an impedance of 12 to 13 psi/gpm at an injection pressure of 1340 psi, but a close-coupled pressure/ time response of the order of seconds. 
Experiment 2049 – Data Package and Preliminary Interpretation\1984\A 2-1/8 inch OD x 16 foot long (slimhole) temperature collar locator tool with the temperature probe on bottom and the collar locator 1-1/2 foot above the probe was run down the 5-1/2 inch tubing in EE-2. Temperature and casing collars were recorded. Turnaround measurements were made (shown in Table I) and no excessive cable drag was observed. The OTIS stinger was easily observed on the collar locator plot at 11,290 - 11,348 feet. Because the OTIS packer was set at 11,348 feet (ESS-6 wireline depth} there was concern that the stinger was sitting on top of the packer. After several , test runs of the sonde out the bottom of the stinger keeping the cable head in the stinger, it was concluded that the packer was not below the stinger. The tool was parked at 11,250 feet and water-was pumped down the 5-1/2 inch tubing at 70 gpm. After 12 minutes the tool was lowered into the 9-5/8 inch casing below the OTIS st1nger. Turnaround did not increase in the casing but the casing collars were off depth. A field correlation was made using the smallest correction (-13 feet). Based on this correlation it appeared that the OTIS stinger was approximately 50 feet higher than it was originally landed and the packer was not where it had been set at 11,348 feet on the 11/27/83 log. The maximum depth logged was 11,593 feet which was about 10 feet above the shoe base on the field correlation. 
Horizontal Stress Trajectories, Fenton Hill\1984\Interpretation of seismic and fluid pressure data is difficult without knowledge of the ambient stress field. There is no pattern of in-situ stress measurements at Fenton Hill, and perhaps little prospect of getting one. So another approach is required. In the UK & Japan it is reported that site results conformed to regional measurements made tens of miles away. While Aldrich & Laughlin is data is of palaeostresses at unknown depth, it conforms with modern seismic results, so a priori, might give useful indications for Fenton Hill. As it turns out, the physical model has unusual and-very well defined character which, I believe, makes it highly probable that the results are accurate for a depth equivalent to 60Mpa below Fenton Hill and are relevant to modern operations. This belief will be justified in a later report. The only previous reported direction for Fenton Hill is 070 deg EofN (Potter, in Aldrich & Laughlin,1982). However I believe the trajectories are rotating rapidly with depth so that figure may well be accurate for the upper reservoir. 
Low-temperature geothermal potential of the Ojo Caliente warm springs area, northern New Mexico\1984\A detailed geochemical investigation of 17 waters (thermal and cold, mineralized and dilute) was performed in the Ojo Caliente-La Madera area. Two types of thermomineral waters have separate and distinctive geologic, geochemical, and geothermal characteristics. The water from Ojo Caliente Resort emerges with temperatures less than or equal to 54/sup 0/C from a Precambrian metarhyolite. Its chemistry, typically Na-HCO/sub 3/, has a total mineralization of 3600 mg/l. Isotopic studies have shown that the thermal water emerges from the springs and a hot well without significant mixing with the cold shallow aquifer of the valley alluvium. However, the cold aquifer adjacent to the resort does contain varying amounts of thermal water that originates from the warm spring system. Geothermometry calculations indicate that the thermal water may be as hot as 85/sup 0/C at depth before its ascent toward surface. Thermodynamic computations on the reaction states of numerous mineral phases suggest that the thermal water will not cause major scaling problems if the hot water is utilized for direct-use geothermal applications. By means of a network of very shallow holes, temperature and electrical conductivity anomalies have been found elsewhere in the valley around Ojo Caliente, and resistivity soundings have confirmed the presence of a plume of thermal water entering the shallow aquifer. The group of lukewarm springs around La Madera, with temperatures less than or equal to 29/sup 0/C, chemical type of NaCaMg-HCO/sub 3/Cl and with a total mineralization less than or equal to 1500 mg/l behaves as a different system without any apparent relation to the Ojo Caliente system. Its temperature at depth is not believed to exceed 35 to 40/sup 0/C.
MARP Report\1984\"This report is written using notes provided by Kei Aki, my own notes taken during the panel discussion, the notes taken by Francis Appert during the panel discussion, and my own recollection of the mood --""of the committee. ., Five specific issues were selected for discussion. For each issue 1 there was extensive discussion among panel members and Los Alamos investigators. The culmination of the discussion of each issue was a set of recommendations by the committee on how to address the issue. "
Planning for Redrilling\1984\The long-range planning committee and HOR project management have been discussing the possibility of obtaining a fracture connection by redrilling. Much of this planning has been of a conceptual nature, e.g., what well could be redrilled, and to what seismic locations. Because there is some possibility of redrilling as early as fall of this year, it is now time to 11 flesh 11 out some of these concepts with more detailed planning. The objective is to identify the long lead hardware and development work that needs to be started very soon, very rough estimates of costs, and identification of those decisions required to allow a more focused plan to be formulated. A small group consisting of George Cocks, Don Dreesen, Bob Nicholson, Fritz Walter, and myself will attempt to take up this task. Bob Hendron is also a member of this group but in view of his other responsibilities, will serve primarily in an advisory role. To begin this planning, we will initially assume that EE-3 will be redrilled, and that it will be sidetracked at depth. There are other scenarios which are still being discussed, such as a new hole, or extending GT-2, but we will defer consideration of these options until they firm up a bit more. We also will defer the issue of a drilling target - in view of the work in progress we accept the fact that the target is a moving one, and will attempt to work with several 11 sample11 drilling trajectories. 
Post Experiment 2042 Kobe Pumping Tests\1984\On May 24 and May 30, EE-3 was pressurized with the Kobe pumps to investigate the nature of the hydraulic connection between the highpressure injection interval below the 4-1/2-in. liner, and the openhole region between the bottom of the 9-5/8-in. casing and the 4-1/2-in. liner. Each of these pumping tests required about three hours to complete. 
Procedure for an EE-3 Vent Experiment, Experiment No. 2045\1984\During Experiment 2042 approximately 2 million gallons of water were injected into the EE-3 wellbore. This caused seismic activity from the bottom of the well to a region well above the casing shoe (3900 m TVD to 2800 m TVD). Thus water was injected into both the lower high pressure zone and the upper low pressure zone just below the casing shoe. Later experiments have shown that these two zones are connected. In the past the upper zone has often been considered to be a water loss zone (thief zone). To be a suitable target for redrilling the 2042 reservoir cannot have excessive water loss and it must be possible to recover, at a reasonable rate, the water that was injected into it. The purpose of this experiment is to investigate the rate at which water can be recovered from the 2042 reservoir, and to obtain information on the type of connection that exists between the upper and lower zones of this reservoir. 
Redrilling Plan for EE-3\1984\In constructing the Phase I system, a slightly inclined injection well was drilled into the hot rock, a large hydraulic fracture was extended from it, and a production well was drilled to intersect the fracture. Several hydraulic-fracturing operations and two redrillings of the production well were required to complete a connected system with satisfactorily low pressure drop. The hydraulic fractures produced were substantially vertical with a north-northwest strike. Modeling of system behavior indicated that heat extraction occurred principally in that part of the fracture system best represented by a circular region between the source at the injection well and the sink at the production well. The Phase I system demonstrated the technical feasibility of creating and operating HOR energy systems. It did not produce heat at a temperature or rate that would support a commercial-scale electrical power plant. Therefore, in 1978, planning began for construction of a larger, hotter Phase II ( 11Engineering 11 ) System that would more nearly approach those requirements, Extrapolation of the Phase I temperature gradient projected a temperature of 480 to 525�F would be reached at a depth of 13,000 ft. 
The Potential for Achieving a Wellbore Connection by Pumping Below the Liner in EE-3\1984\From an examination of the double-tool hodogram-derived microseismic event locations for both Experiments 2032 and 2020, it is apparent that there exists a roughly cylindrical exclusion zone surrounding the EE-3 wellbore, with a minimum radius of about 110 m. The density of events outside this exclusion zone appears to be somewhat higher around the lower openhole region of EE-3 (below the liner) than around the liner itself or above the liner. We have previously postulated -- most recently by Tom Dey in the above-referenced memorandum -- that this microseismic event exclusion zone is actually a pore-pressure-occluded region surrounding the EE-3 wellbore. This occluded region would have resulted from the slow radial diffusion of pressurized fluid from the EE-3 wellbore, which had been kept full -representing a wellbore pressure level about 800 psi above the surrounding static pore pressure -- during the intervening 2-1/2 years since the hole was completed in mid 1980. We here assert that if water is injected into the EE-3 openhole interval below the cemented-in liner, at a suitable flow rate and for a sufficient time, we stand a good chance of being able to break through this occluded zone from within. This- would allow us to connect into the large multiply-fractured region that almost completely surrounds the openhole interval of EE-3 below the ~iner. It is suggested that up to two million gallons of water injected at 10 BPM, and at pressures of about 6000 psi, would be required to achieve - significant hydraulic communication with the EE-2 fracture system first formed during Experiments 2018 and 2020, and then greatly extended during the MHF test. 
Wellbore Trajectories into the Phase II Reservoir\1984\In order to establish a new deep HDR-system in the crystalline rock mass below Fenton Hill, new holes into the reservoirs created in the hydraulic tests 2032 end 2042 have been proposed. A decision to drill the new wellbore into one of these two reservoirs was made in summer of 1984. At this time it was decided by the HOR program Management to restrict the planning of the new wellbores to trajectories out of the existing wells EE-1, 6T-2 or EE-3 in order to avoid excessive costs. According to planning guide-lines, which resulted from a Meeting held in October 1984, the new hole should also pass near the injection areas, penetrate the seismic clouds as Much as possible and have as simple a trajectory es possible. Most important was to Maximize the distance of achieving a hydraulic connection, the Main goal of this redrilling task:- Attempts to free the casing in well GT-2 have so far failed. Because it is still unknown how well EE-2 can be repaired, the planning for the new wellbore has to include alternatives for the use of well EE-2. The Method used to calculate wellbore trajectories is based on two 20-spline functions. This Method Minimizes the SUM of all curvature increments between the first end the last given trajectory-point .  
Analysis of the EE-3A Temperature Logs Following the Expt. 2064 Pre-Pump\1985\From Nov. 25 to Dec. 1. 1985, 189,700 gallons of Fenton Hill well water were injected into EE-2 using the big Kobe pump (at 34 gpm). Temperature logs were run in EE-3A on Dec. 3 and 5 to assess the results of this reservoir reinflation. EE-2 Pressurization After several false starts due to clogged filters, pumping into EE-2 finally began at 1605 hrs on 11/25/85. The wellhead pressure rose rapidly from 60 psi to 455 psi in 1-1/2 hours, and then finally leveled out at about 625 psi by 0830 hrs the next morning (11/26). After having injected a total of 83,100 gallons, the EE-2 pumping was shut down at 0900 hrs on the 27th at a final injection pressure of 645 psi. Pumping into EE-2 was resumed at 1040 hrs on 11/29/85, after a two-day shutin over Thanksgiving. In the intervening 50 hours, the EE-2 wellhead pressure had decayed to zero (no data recorded). Starting from O psi, the pressure at EE-2 increased rapidly to 440 psi by 1200 hrs, and then more gradually to 625 psi by 0300 hrs the next morning (11/30/85), and finally to 715 psi by noon on 12/1/85. EE-2 pumping was terminated at 1830 hrs on Dec. 1 after having injected a total of 189,700 gallons since the start of pumping on 11/25/85. The Venting of EE-3 
Another Reservoir Connection in EE-3\1985\"A temperature log in EE-3 on Friday afternoon. May 10, shown in figure 1 indicates another connection into EE-3. This new connection, which appears to be a composite of three joints from 12,000 to 12,150 feet, produced about 25 gpm. This estimation results from a heat transfer analysis of the temperature log, and is confirmed by other estimates, namely visible estimates of 40-60 gpm, and the mudlogger's estimate of 10-20 gpm. For comparison. the earlier EE-3 connection shown in figure 2 and discussed in reference 1. was observed in the May 1 temperature log, and occurred at 11,440 feet, and flowed about 10 gpm. For both connections we still lack boron/lithium tracer confirmation. presumably because recent EE-3 pumping has driven the tracer back toward EE-2, where it was injected. This most recent observation of a reservoir connection is puzzling, because at the time of its observance it had been nine days since we had pressurized EE-2. Hence EE-3 must be responding to some residual high pressure field somewhere in the rock between the two wells. Thus the connection to EE-2 is highly indirect. and if EE-2 must remain a low pressure producing well, the overall impedance from EE-3 to EE-2, may be high. Another possibility, that this ""connection"" is simply a return of fluid lost to the formation while drilling. or from the previous packer test, is unfounded. Don Brown reports that we have had essentially no recent drilling fluid losses, and the temperature log shows the new connection at a depth that wasn't even drilled to at the time of the packer test. "
CO2 Flow in the EE-3 Annulus\1985\Don Brown asked me to look at how much CO2 would be required to produce a 600 psi pressure change in the EE-3 annulus. If a column of water were replaced by a column of co2 , at 500 psi and 50� C, 1583 feet would be required to produced a 600 psi change in the static head. In the annulus between 9 5/8 inch casing and 4 1/2 inch tubing, this amounts to about 43 mscf of gas. (This is a conservative number and in reality, almost 80 mscf of co2 would be required due the pressure gradient in the CO2 column itself). This is a lot of gas. If this much gas were to flow through the annulus for 1500 feet, under a 500 psi pressure differential, flow rates on the order of 200mscf/hr. can be expected. In other words, a good size gas blowdown lasting for 15-30 mins. may be expected if this much CO2 were vented. 
Collection and analysis of geothermal gases\1985\Rapid, reliable procedures are described for the collection and analysis of geothermal gases at Los Alamos National Laboratory. Gases covered are H/sub 2/, He, Ar, O/sub 2/, N/sub 2/, CH/sub 4/, C/sub 2/H/sub 6/, CO/sub 2/, and H/sub 2/S. The methods outlined are suitable for geothermal exploration. 8 refs., 5 figs., 2 tabs.
Comments for Experiment 2065\1985\Experiment 2065 is designed to evaluate the nature of the reverse low pressure connection recently observed from EE-2 to EE-3A. The primary obJect1ve of Experiment 2065 is to aid in the execution of the upcoming Experiment 2064 by providing additional information for the decision making process during the deep stimulation of EE-3A. In addition, Experiment 2065 will also provide data of scientific nature regarding reservoir flow characteristics, reservoir volume and geochemistry. If an early connection is evident during the deep Experiment 2064, all is well. However, should this not occur, a decision will have to be made as to when to abort the Experiment 2064. If a deep reverse connection is observed in Experiment 2065, it will argue for prolonged pumping in 2064 even if no connection is evident. On the other hand, if no deep reverse connection is seen in 2065, and the hydraulic and seismic data in 2064 is discouraging, it will argue for an early abortion of 2064, resulting in significant potential savings to the project. The reverse connection has interesting characteristics: flow occurred at low pressures (<700 psi) and the connection appeared to be through the fracture system of Experiment 2062 (the deeper of the two phase II connections). Measurement of outflow rates and pressure during Experiment 2065, along with a flowing temperature log will answer questions regarding flow impedances, flow entries and flow splits. Geochemistry tests will provide information about reservoir volume and temperatures. 
Diagnostic Tests in EE-2 Experiment 2056\1985\Analysis of the temperature data from the Kuster gauge run on April 25, 1985 indicates the possibility that the fluid flow is upward along the well, and may be communicating with a 11 thief11 zone. To investigate this possibility a series of temperature logs and pressure tests are proposed. These test should be run when the wellhead pressure in EE-2 is 1000 psi or less. 
EE-3A Temperature and Caliper Log, Experiment 2060\1985\Temperature and Caliper logs were run in EE-3A on 6/18/85 in preparation for Experiment 2061 planned for 6/19/85 (Expt 2061).
Experiment 2054: Pressurization and Temperature Surveys in EE-3A\1985\"By Thursday morning (4/25/85), the depth of EE-3A will be close to 10,300 ft and EE-2 will be shut in for Superpump repairs. This appears to be a good time to evaluate EE-3A under pressure to determine any new zones of fluid acceptance or production. After running a background temperature log to TD, EE-3A would be pressurized with both rig pumps (""'720 gpm) for one hour and then shut in. Following a shut-in temperature log of the openhole interval, EE-3A would be vented back and logged again one hour after beginning the vent. "
Experiment 2059: Second Packer Stimulation of EE-3A\1985\By late Thursday, 5-9-85, EE-3A should be at a depth of about 12,200 feet. We plan to stop drilling at this point and pressurize the bottom 600 to 700 feet of the open hole using a Lynes packer. The Lynes packer would be set somewhere in the interval of very competent, slow-drilling, and only slightly altered biotite granodiorite from 11,460 ft to 11,590 ft. This would place the packer below the two fractures (at 10,880 ft and 11,000 ft) stimulated during Expt. 2057, and also below the producing fracture at 11,440 ft as reported on 5-2-85. This time, we are planning for a 24-hour (nominal) injection test at EE-3A, with a pumping pressure limit of 6000 psi. The injection flow rate will be about 10 BPM, with three Dowell pumpers on line. In 24 hours at a nominal 10 BPM, we will have injected 600,000 gallons into EE-3A. We plan to use an OTIS coil tubing unit (using nitrogen gas) to clean out the bottom of EE-2 on Friday 5-10-85. Following this cleanout, the OTIS unit would be placed on standby through Sunday (5-12-85) to unload EE-2 during the pumping phase at EE-3A, if desirable. In any case, EE-2 will be vented during the packer stimulation test at EE-3A. 
Experiment 2061 – The Unsuccessful Attempt to Connect EE-3A and EE-2 by Injection in EE-3A Below a Packer Set at 12555 Feet\1985\Experiment 2061 was an unsuccessful attempt to hydraulicallly connect wells EE-3A and EE-2 by injecting water into the rock below an open hole packer set at 12,555 ft. In an earlier, more successful attempt, Experiment 2059, conducted at the end of May 1985, the packer had been set at 11,537 ft. In a later attempt, Experiment 2062, conducted July 20-23, 1985, the packer was set at 11,970 ft. and again a successful connection was obtained. Despite the fact that a connection was not obtained in the present experiment, the results obtained are significant because of the information they provide about well logs, fracture pressures, seismicity, and reservoir characterization. Experiment 2061 was conducted from June 29, 1985 through July 2, 1985. An earlier attempt at running the experiment was aborted when the packer failed after about 40 minutes of pumping June 20. Prior to the first attempt a temperature survey and 3-arm caliper were run in EE-3A (Experiment 2060). During the caliper run only two arms were functional and a packer seat was selected based on the 2-arm average and information from the temperature survey, this proved to be inadequate. Analysis of the mode of packer failure lead to the conclusion that the packer had been set in a washed out zone . 
Experiment 2061: Packer Stimulation of the Deepest Portion of EE-3A\1985\At our present rate of drilling, EE-3A should have been drilled to a final depth of 13,100 ft by next Monday, 6-17-85. We then plan to stimulate the bottom portion of the role by setting a Lynes packer sane 400 to 600 ft off bottom, to be determined from the temperature and caliper logs run during Expt. 2060 and mud log. We plan to pump into this bottom zone of EE-3A at a nominal rate of 6 BPM for up to 72 hours, with an early higher flow interval (about 12 hours) at from 10 to 12 BPM. The total injection will be about 1.2 million gallons. 
Experiment 2062: Packer Stimulation of the Intermediate Portion of EE-3A (Below 12,000 FT)\1985\The deepest EE-3A interval stimulated during Expt. 2061 did not connect to EE-2, but rather extended a fractured region downwards some 300 m below the bottom of EE-3A. Therefore, the decision has been made to abandon for now the bottom 600 feet of EE-3A, and to stimulate the three flowing fractures between 12,050 ft and 12,200 ft identified by temperature logging prior to Expt. 2059 (our successful Memorial Day reservoir connection experiment). EE-3A will first be sanded up to a depth of about 12,600 ft to seal off all six of the fractures opened during Expt. 2061 -- when the packer was set at a depth of 12,555 ft. '!he new packer will then be set at a depth of about 12,000 ft; below the main two fractures at 11,750 ft and 11,950 ft stimulated during Expt. 2059, but above the three flowing fractures discussed above. The actual packer seat will be determined from caliper logs run this week in combination with the results from the USGS televiewer log run previously and the Exlog/Smith mud log obtained during drilling. Experiment 2062 will essentially be a repeat of Expt. 2061 in almost all details except for the packer setting depth. We again plan to pump into EE-3A at a nominal rate of 6 BPM for up to 72 hours, with an early higher flow interval (about 12 hours) at a rate of from 10 to 12 BPM. '!he total EE-3A injection could be as much as 1.2 million gallons. 
Experiment 2062: The Post Experiment 2061 Temperature Log\1985\The log is attached. Also shown is the pre-Exp 2061 log. Of particular interest is the temperature depression near bottomhole. The depression indicates a fracture which takes the bulk of the flow. Considerable structure is evident from 12,700 ft to 13,100 ft indicating a fracture zone. Sane flow entrances are also present at 12,000 ft and the thief zone at 10,250 ft. The fracture zones around 12,000 ft have been masked by flow up the wellbore after the packer failed 
Experiment 2063 – String Shots at the Bottom of Wellbore EE-3A\1985\During the early phase of redrilling of wellbore EE-3A, experiment 2050 was attempted, whose goal was to place a string shot at the bottom of wellbore EE-3A and use the Precambrian seismic network to locate the position of the wellbore relative to the network and hence the seismic cloud. The experiment proposal for experiment 2050 is dated 19 February, 1985 and is number ESS-4-85-52. Experiment 2050 was never successfully completed because the string shot package was unable to pass beyond the region where the Whipstock was placed in wellbore EE-3 to sidetrack to EE-3A. Experiment 2063 is meant to be a repeat of experiment 2050 with a modified string shot package that will hopefully be able to pass by the whipstock without getting stuck. The goal of experiment 2050 was to locate the position of the bottom of wellbore EE-3A relative to the precambrian network and thus relative to the seismic cloud which we have drilled through. In addition to finding the location of EE-3A relative to the seismic cloud during experiment 2062, we also hope to obtain a reliable estimate of the travel time residuals <P and S) to station PC-2. Since PC-2 was installed after the most recent successful calibration experiment, we have no travel time corrections for this station. Since PC-2 is located much further from the precambrian contact than PC-1, the travel time residual is expected to be larger than that for PC-1. Determining a reliable estimate of travel time corrections to PC-2 by using well located earthquakes has provided a rough estimate of the correction but a much more reliable one can be obtained from string shots. 
Experiment 2063 String Shot EE-3A September 30 thru October 2, 1985\1985\The last experiment #2062 which was packer and cross flow test between and EE-3A and EE-2 wellbore was successfully completed on 7-21-85. The EE-3A well was then shut in to monitor pressure decay; vented, packer removed and finally temperature logged from 9000 ft to 12551 to confirm fracture fluid entrance points in the wellbore. After logging operations were completed the sand plug was circulated from the wellbore to a depth of 13000 ft. EE-3A was then shut in and the rig released to standby-secured on 7-26-85. The EE-3A well presently shows no surface pressure and has shown no pressure at surface since it was shut in on 7-26-85. We have no estimate as to what depth the fluid level is or what percent gas may be present in the wellbore. The well had been treated with corrosion inhibitor prior to shut-in and the inhibitor should still be in wellbore. 
Experiment 2064: Stimulation of the Deepest Part of EE-2A\1985\The next fracture stimulation test in EE-3A is planned over the openhole interval from 12,555 ft to 12,850 ft. Following Expt. 2062 in mid July, the sand was washed out of EE-3A down to a depth of about 13,000 ft. However, it has now been decided to sand up an additional 150 ft of EE-3A -- with a barite plug on top -- bringing the hole depth to 12,850 ft (drill pipe measurement). This hole depth (12850) is now about 180 ft above the bottom of the MHF fractured region at 13,030 ft which was activated (pressure stimulated) from EE-2 during Expt. 2032. The pressurized interval for Expt. 2064 will be 295 ft long, considerably less than that for Expt. 2059 (465 ft), Expt. 2061 (627 ft), or Expt. 2062 (524 ft). This interval, as shown in Fig. 1, contains only the upper three of the six small fracture connections previously stimulated during Expt. 2061, and represents a net flow potential of only about 15% of that available during Expt. 2061. Besides severely restricting the flow entrances available for Expt. 2064, two other changes are being made to increase the available downhole fracturing pressure for the same maximum surface pressure used during Expt. 2061. 
Experimental and Drilling Coordination During the Redrilling of EE-2A\1985\The EE-3A redrilling campaign begins this week, and will extend into June, 1985. Following the completion of drilling, there will be an extensive series of reservoir tests and evaluations that are presently only broadly defined due to the large number of unknowns involved. The purpose of this memorandum is to set forth a Fenton Hill technical management and coordinating team to accomplish the two primary objectives of the redrilling and testing program: During the redrilling program at Fenton Hill, Bert Dennis will assume the new project position of Experiment Coordinator in addition to his present assignment as Task Leader for Instrumentation and Logging. In this role, Bert will coordinate all Fenton Hill experiments -- as first proposed, then reviewed by Bert Dennis and Hugh Murphy, and then approved by Don Brown -- with the Fenton Hill Operations Staff, ESS-6, and other involved groups or subcontractors. He will also appoint an Experiment Manager for each experiment. Bob Hendron will continue as Task Leader for Fenton Hill Operations, with John Schillo as his alternate. 
Expt. 2059 (The Connection) EE-3A Packer Test #3 Hydraulic Data\1985\The third packer test in EE-3A was conducted on May 27 and 28, 1985. The bottomhole assembly consisted of a Lynes inflatable openhole packer, a choke sub and an expansion joint. This was run in the hole on 4 1/211 drill pipe. The packer was seated at a pipe depth of 11,537 ft in EE-3A. The T-D at this time was 12,203 ft. After successfully seating and inflating the packer, the expansion joint was unjayed and the flow test was commenced. A slug of a Fluorescein dye was inserted in the flowstring to serve as a chemical tracer. A total of 422,770 gal of water was pumped into the EE-3 frontside over a period of 20.15 hrs. The injection flowrates ranged from 1 bpm to 10 bpm with the bulk of the fluid being injected at 6.2 and 9.5-10 bpm. During this injection, the EE-3 backside pressure was maintained between about 250-550 psi. This was accomplished by injecting a total of 91,570 gal of water with the rig pumps. The well EE-2 was alternately vented and shut-in through out the test (Murphy, 5/28/85). The testing events are summarized in Table I (prepared from notes taken by Jim Miller, Don Dreesen, Hugh Murphy, Sharad Kelkar and Verdis McDowell). 
Fluid Flow in Deformable Rock Joints – Part I\1985\"If fluid is injected into joints in rock masses, several types of joint deformations can take place. At first the pressure rise in the joint is small enough that the joint does not actually open. Nevertheless, the effective closure stress, that is, the difference between the total earth stress acting normal to the joint plane and the fluid pressure, is reduced. Consequently the tightness of joint closure is lessened, resulting in a small increase of the effective open space, or aperture, of the joint (Snow, 1968). If the fluid pressure rise is small enough, the aperture can still be treated as nearly constant, and the pressure response therefore follows the usual laws of linear diffusion. But if the pressure increase is large, aperture increases must be accounted for, and the flow will be affected by nonlinear diffusion due to pressure-dependent aperture, as well as a new storage coefficient due to joint compressibility. Eventually the fluid pressure may attain a value equal to, and even slightly greater than, the original total earth stress, and the opposing surfaces of the rock that meet at the joint can actually part. We refer to this behavior as joint ""liftoff,"" or ""jacking."" During liftoff, the changes in joint aperture and compressibility are very large compared with changes while the joint is still in roughness-to-roughness contact along the joint surfaces, and the flow equation becomes so highly nonlinear that pressure pulses are no longer transmitted in a smooth, diffusive manner but as a traveling contact discontinuity, analogous to a propagating hydrodynamic shock wave. "
Fracture Orientations from Last Two Cores and USGS Televiewer\1985\Fractures visible in the last two cores from EE-3A were oriented as well as fractures visible in a portion of the USGS televiewer log. The televiewer fractures align with the 2032 seismic cloud. Fractures in these cores have the same dip as the 2032 seismic cloud but the wrong azimuth, irregardless of whether the single shot or paleomagnetic orientation was used. Consequently, we probably have total failure to orient the core by these two methods. The four cores cut during the EE-3A drilling campaign are summarized in Table I below. Paleomagnetic methods and either single shot tool or steering tool were used to orient each core. In addition, the USGS televiewer was used in the intervals 10800-10900 ft and 11080-12180 ft. Because of poor image quality and borehole wall quality, only the televiewer interval 11400-11800 ft shows fractures easily identifiable and measurable by a casual observer. 
Fracturing Pressures in EE-3A\1985\"Fracturing pressures (Pf) in EE-3A are summarized in table 1 and presented in figure 1 against the vertical depth along with previous results. Filled in symbols are used to indicate current data, superposed on previous data shown by open symbols. The reported values are based on the results of various packer tests conducted as a part of the 1985 redrilling campaign: experiments 2049, 2057, 2059, 2061, and 2062. This memo is divided in two parts First part deals with the actual results and the details of data analysis. The second section is a general discussion of ""Fracturing Pressures"", included here for completeness, although most people are already well familiar with it. "
High-temperature borehole instrumentation\1985\A new method of extracting natural heat from the earth's crust was invented at the Los Alamos National Laboratory in 1970. It uses fluid pressures (hydraulic fracturing) to produce cracks that connect two boreholes drilled into hot rock formations of low initial permeability. Pressurized water is then circulated through this connected underground loop to extract heat from the rock and bring it to the surface. The creation of the fracture reservior began with drilling boreholes deep within the Precambrian basement rock at the Fenton Hill Test Site. Hydraulic fracturing, flow testing, and well-completion operations required unique wellbore measurements using downhole instrumentation systems that would survive the very high borehole temperatures, 320/sup 0/C (610/sup 0/F). These instruments were not available in the oil and gas industrial complex, so the Los Alamos National Laboratory initiated an intense program upgrading existing technology where applicable, subcontracting materials and equipment development to industrial manufactures, and using the Laboratory resource to develop the necessary downhole instruments to meet programmatic schedules. 60 refs., 11 figs.
Hot Dry Rock Geothermal Energy Development Program. Annual report, fiscal year 1983\1985\Emphasis was on hydraulic-fracturing experiments at depths around 3.5 km (11,473 ft) in the two inclined wells of the Phase II system at Fenton Hill, New Mexico; on improved facilities and techniques for mapping the source locations of acoustic signals generated by the fracturing events; on mathematical modeling of the fracture systems produced in these and earlier experiments; and on development of a family of slimline high-temperature downhole instruments that can be used within or through relatively small-diameter pressure tubing. Hydraulic fracturing at a vertical depth of approximately 3500 m (11,500 ft) in well EE-2, the deeper well, produced fractures that, in acoustic maps, appear to occupy a large, roughly ellipsoidal volume whose major axis is directed to the north of the other well, EE-3. Hydraulic fracturing from EE-3 at a similar depth produced another set of fractures that appear to be approximately parallel to and centered about 180 m (600 ft) east of the earlier set. Subsequent fluid injections reduced the distance between the two sets, but no hydraulic connection between them was established. Modeling the silica concentrations of fluid circulated through the earlier Phase I system indicates that this type of permeation also contributes significantly to heat extraction during system operation. The precision and accuracy of locating the sources of acoustic signals detected during hydraulic-fracturing operations have been increased by improvements in equipment, drilling of another deep hole for geophone emplacement, and additional station calibrations. Analysis of the signals has also been improved and broadened. Development of slimline downhole instruments has included a detonator tool, a geophone package, and final design of a high-temperature borehole acoustic televiewer. A crosswell acoustic transceiver has also been developed for investigating rock type and structure between wellbores. 32 refs., 35 figs.
Initial Seismology Results from Experiment 2062\1985\"Experiment 2062, the second hydraulic fracturing experiment of the Phase II system to produce a connection, was conducted July 18 to 21. Seismic monitoring was carried out for a period of 80 hours, starting at the onset of pumping, about 00:20 on July 18, and ending about 6 hours after shut-in of EE-3a, at 18:30 on July 21. During this time, a total of about 500 microearthquakes were digitally recorded on the Biomations, of which 290 (60%) were analyzed at Fenton Hill during the experiment. Event locations scatter through a volume with dimensions about 500 m (N - S), 200 m (up - down), and 200 m (thick). locations generally scatter to the south from the injection interval in EE-3A; few are near the EE-2 ""production"" zone. In contrast to events from experiment 2061, the 2062 locations are generally no deeper than the EE-3A injection zone (about 3700 m) and show a slight upward migration. Interestingly, the 2062 locations intermingle with those from 2032, although the denser clusters of events from 2062 appear to occur where relatively little activity did in 2032. "
Possible Flow Geometry of Experiment 2059\1985\"From the core taken from the interval 11600'-11615' in EE-3A we can find the predominant fracture sets at this depth. Assuming the 2059 flow from EE-3A to EE-2 follows these fractures, a simple flow path geometry can be constructed. The length of the shortest possible path along these fractures is 1.7 times the straight line distance between 2059 injection interval in EE - 3A and the 2032 injection interval in EE-2. The fractures in the core can be divided into two sets: Set. 1 dipping 65� towards S57W and Set 2 dipping 78� towards SlOW. None of these fractures run directly from the 2059 injection interval to the 2032 injection interval. The simplest path available is to leave EE-3A on a fracture from one set and arrive at EE-2 on a fracture from the other set. Figure 1 shows a stereopair in which flow leaves EE-3A on a fracture from Set land arrives at EE-2 on fracture from Set 2. The view direction is from the southeast, Fig. 2 shows the same geometry from the southwest. EE-2 is located on the hidden plane in this diagram. The shortest possible flow path length following fractures is 278m or 1.7 times the direct line distance. Fig. 3 shows the geometry where flow leaves EE-3A on Set 2 and arrives at EE-2 on Set 1. The view is from the northwest. Fig. 4 is the same geometry viewed from the southwest with EE-2 on the hidden plane. The shortest possible path is again 278m. In both geometries, about 200m the path is along Set 1 or NW-SE and about 77m is along Set 2 or E-W so it probably doesn't matter much which one chooses as most likely. The available heat transfer area and fracture volume can be estimated from with the aid of Fig. 3 from Robinson's recent tracer memo (Bruce Robinson, ""Tracer and Geochemistry Analysis - Expt. 2059"", ESS-4-85-151, June 6 , 1985). The one-sided area of a 280m diam. circle is about 6.lxl04m2. Goin~ to Robinson's Fig. 3 gives an estimated reservoir volume of 300m. This is right in the middle of Robinson's l50m3-600m3 range of estimate, so this very simple flow path model has some merit. "
Post Experiment 2059 Temperature Log in EE-2A – May 29, 1985\1985\Experiment 2059 resulted in the pumping of .42 million gallons in EE-3A at up to 10 bpm. Flow stopped at 1020 on May 28. After removal of the packer and continuous venting of EE-3A the log- was run at 2330 on May 29. To control the gas surging, a flowrate into the well at 40 bpm was established and maintained throughout the log-. Figure 1 shows the log in EE-3A from 0 - 9000 ft. Of note in the figure is the anomalous temperature behavior in the region 0 - 4000 ft. This is probably due to the large quantity of gas that was vented prior to the log and the 1/2 hr of pumping into the well before the log. Figure 2 shows the lower EE-3A log on an expanded scale. Also shown in the figure is the pre-experiment log run on 5/10/85. It is evident from the most recent log that the major water inlets were at 11700 ft and 11900 ft with minor inlets at 12000 ft and 12100 ft. This is in contrast with the log taken before the pumping where the major flow entrances appeared to be about 12000 ft. 
Post Experiment 2062 Temperature Log\1985\Attached is the temperature survey in EE-3A run following the conclusion of Exp. 2062. In this experiment 1.524M gallons were injected and a connection with EE-2 established. Prior to logging, EE-3A was subjected to drill pipe circulation and venting. Apparent in the log are fractures at 12,000 ft, 12,100 ft and 12,300 ft. The packer depth is about 11,970 ft. The fractures at 12,000 ft and 12,100 ft were first noted when EE-3A was drilled. At that time some of the lower fractures (opened in Exp. 2059) were also visible. The fracture at 12,300 ft was not evident at that time. A major alteration zone was, however, noted. This suggests that it may be of interest to test the zone from 12,100 ft to 12,500 ft separately. 
Preliminary Impedance Measurements During Experiment 2059\1985\"Experiment 2059 was conducted on 5/27-28/85. water was injected in EE-3 using the downhole packer set at 11,537 feet. The purpose of the injection was to stimulate the connection noted earlier from temperature surveys in EE-3A by Dash, Zyvoloski and Murphy, and frau pressure rises noted by Ibn Brown in EE-2 when EE-3A was injected. Disregarding the short time, low flow rates, the major flow of the present injection was carried out at 6, 8 and 10 bpm. About 1/2 hour after the start of the 6 bpm injection, sufficient pressure developed at the shut-in EE-2 to vent it and measure the rate of induced flow from EE-2 . Later EE-2 was shut-in for 40 to 60 minute periods on five successive occasions and then vented for about an hour between each shut-in , in an operation analogous to ""surging"", which is often successful in increasing the productivity of wells. The major results are as follows. (Shut-in is designated as S.I.) "
Preliminary Stress and Fracture Orientation from the First Three Cores\1985\The first three cores in EE-3A have had their fractures oriented and the in situ stress estimated strain recovery and lab overcore methods. Substantial differences in fracture and stress orientation occur between the first core, representing the Phase I reservoir, and the second and third cores, taken from the Phase II reservoir. All three cores were oriented mechanically using a steering tool on the first core and single shot tools on the second and third. The first two have also been oriented by paleomagnetic methods. The orientations do not agree. Currently, I favor the paleomagnetic results. 
Recent developments in the hot dry rock geothermal energy program\1985\In recent years, most of the Hot Dry Rock Programs effort has been focused on the extraction technology development effort at the Fenton Hill test site. The pair of approximately 4000 wells for the Phase II Engineering System of the Fenton Hill Project have been completed. During the past two years, hydraulic fracture operations have been carried out to develop the geothermal reservoir. Impressive advances have been made in fracture identification techniques and instrumentation. To develop a satisfactory interwellbore flow connection the next step is to redrill the lower section of one of the wells into the fractured region. Chemically reactive tracer techniques are being developed to determine the effective size of the reservoir area. A new estimate has been made of the U.S. hot dry rock resource. based upon the latest geothermal. gradient data. An updated economic study is in progress by EPRI
Recommended Testing of the 12,000’ – 12,200’ Zone in EE-3A\1985\�xpt 2059 demonstrated a connection between EE-3A and EE2. Subsequent temperature logs showed that most of the water pumped in this test was accepted by the zone near 11,700', while some fluid did enter the formation between 12.000 - 12,200 (Zyvoloski, ESS-4-85-140). The injection pressures for the 11. 700 1 zone were noted to be anomalously low (Kelkar, ESS-4-85-150). The connection volume appears to be limited (Robinson, ESS-4-85-151) and could be improved with a connection to EE-2 from the deeper 12,000 - 12,200 zone. Hence it is recommended that, if the opportunity presents itself, this zone be --isolated from the 11,700' interval and tested. Testing procedure would be similar to that of Expt 2059. Testing rates are recommended around 6 - 10 bpm. Injection pressures are expected to be somewhat higher that those in 2059 (red line on 7,000 psi). Test duration should be about 40 - 70 hours, to be determined based on the requirements imposed by tracer experiments. Tracers should be used to evaluate the fracture volume. Pretest and post test temperature logs should be run. 
Reservoir Testing During the Redrilling Campaign\1985\Ihe redrilling program in EE-3A was initiated after failing to connect wellbores EE-2 and EE-3 with several massive hydraulic fracturing tests. These included injecting up to 5 .6M gallons (21,20Cm3) of water into EE-2 and up to 2M gallons (757Cm3) of water into EE-3. The redrilling trajectory was established after consideration of seismic events mapping during massive hydraulic fracturing in EE-2 and EE-3. '1he original wellbore trajectories along with the EE-3A redrilling trajectory are shown in Figure 1. Also shown in the figure are seismic event locations. As can be seen from the figure, the redrilling trajectory intersects the two major seismic zones created by previous pump tests. This memo discusses reservoir tests during redrilling up to the time of the successful connection. This connection was accomplished during Expt. 2059 and its results are discussed separately in memos by Kelkar (ESS-4-85-150), Murphy and Brown (ESS-4-8S-137), and Robinson (F.SS-4-8S-151). 
Results of Experiment 2054: Pressurization and Temperature Surveys in EE-3A\1985\On Friday, April 26, a temperature log of EE-3A was performed after pressurization of the wellbore and fracture system with the rig pumps at about 740 gpm. Several interesting events occurred during this experiment which suggested that the reservoir should be tested for possible communication between EE-2 and EE-3A. Additional pump tests proved that there is no hydraulic connection between the wells. This report summarizes the temperature logs and subsequent pumping experiments. 
Seimicity During EE-3A Redrilling Phase – Results to Date – May 13, 1985\1985\During the time interval from 19 April 1985 to 3 May 1985 seismic events induced by the various pumping tests in EE-2 and EE-3A have been recorded. Seismic observations have been made using PreCambrian network stations R:-1, PC-2 and Gl'-1 and beginning 26 April, EE-1. The cumulative number of seismic events plotted as a function of time is shown in Figure 1. (thanks to Bob lotter). There is a clear increase in the rate at which events occur beginning with the pump into the EE-3 open hole section on 26 April. To study the seismicity, a subset of the events have been replayed from the analog magnetic tapes into the Biomation digitizers and to the HP9845 computers. Sane data was captured in real time by the Biomations (e.g. on 2 May during experiment 2057, the second EE-3 packer test). Arrival times were picked and events were located. Since no station corrections are available for R:-2, the newest PreCambrian seismic station, a station correction for PC-2 was estimated using a joint location scheme. No attempt has been made to choose only the best quality events for use in finding station corrections so the result may be subject to sane error. Data from very bad events were eliminated prior to calculating PC-2 station corrections. PC-2 corrections used were 12.2 msec for P and 24.8 msec for S. This compares with corrections for FC-1 of 4.6 msec and 10.2 msec respectively. It is reasonable for FC-2 corrections to .be larger than those for R:-1 since presumably the PC-2 geophone is further from the granitic basement than the FC-1 phone. 
Seismic Events from Experiment 2059\1985\"During the 20 hours of injection during Experiment 2059, a total of 20 events were captured on the Biomation digitizers, of which 12 were possibly locatable (four or more arrivals at three or more stations). From this meager set of seismic events, we were actually able to locate only three events (25t). Seismic arrivals may be contaminated by raypath effects, possibly the result of interactions with the water-inflated 2032 fracture system. The difficulty of locating the events may result from these ray effects (travel time delays, and/or mode conversions). The three events are not located particularly near the 2059 injection interval, and, hence, may indicate that the 2Q59 injection produced additional fracturing of the general region of the 2032 fracture system. The lack of event locations near the 2059 injection region is consistent with the hypothesis that microearthquake producing stresses had already been relieved by the fluid injected during the preceding experiment 2032. Although the total number of events recorded was very small, the statistics of the 2059 events (pumped volume before first event occurred, and fraction of ""volumetric moment"" seen seismically) are similar to those of experiment 2032. We are attempting to obtain locations of additional 2059 events by additional scrutiny of the arrival times and phases, and by refining the station corrections used. "
Surface Pressure Estimates for Phase II Long Term Tests\1985\"EE-3A surface pumping pressures have been estimated to aid in the design of the long term phase II pumping tests. It is expected that the EE-3A - EE-2 connection obtained in Expt. 2062 will be exploited for this purpose {this occurs at~l2000 feet in EE-3-A). The estimated pressures are shown in Figure 1 versus pumping rates. Two extreme temperatures are considered: no cool down - 250�C and maximum cool down - 50�C. The estimates were obtained by extrapolating the surface data from Expt. 2062 to bottomhole conditions subtracting the effects of choke, packer and string and then correcting these for the expected EE-3A configuration of the long term test. The calculations are based on a temporary {?) EE-3-A completion with about 300 1 of 4 1/2"" liner with 4 1/2"", 15.1# tubing to the surface. Bottomhole pressure calculations include hydrostatic pressure with water for a linear temperature gradient and tubing friction with temperature dependent viscosity and flow velocities. The results shown in figure 1 are based on the results of a short-term test. Fracture extension pressures may drop with time over long term due to reservoir cooldown. "
Temperature Logs in EE-2 and EE-3A – Pumping Test in EE-2 – May 3, 1985\1985\"The log in EE-2 was a flowing log (6 gpm) which followed the pumping of more than 1.3 million gallons into the well and was approximately 24 hours after the pumping was stopped. Figure 1 shows the log in EE-2 as well as a background log. The flattening in the 8000-10000 feet region can be explained by annular flow, a possibility is flow out through the breach in the casing and up the annulus. The features of the log are less dramatic than those obtained on May 1 (Murphy, ESS-4-85-119). The temperature log in EE-3 is shown in figure 3. Figure 4 shows a previous log in EE-3 on May 1. The ""flow entrance"" (11400 ~) evident on May 1, has been masked somewhat by thermal recovery. The major feature at 10250 feet continues and a new feature appears near where the packer was set at 10840 feet. The pumping in EE-2 produced no new hydraulic information except that there appears to be sane connection between the frontside and backside. Figure 5 shows a start up of a pumping sequence in EE-2. Of note is the positive correlation of the pressures in the pipe and backside before the expected negative correlation appears due to thermal compression. "
Temperature Survey of EE-3A – November 5, 1985\1985\"A temperature survey was run in EE-3A at 1216 hours, November 5, 1985. The objective of the survey was to obtain a no-flow background survey prior to upcoming Experiment 2064. During the survey no flow was apparent, although upon opening the wellhead a slight (~20 psi) pressure was observed. The survey is presented in Figure 1 and Figure 2. The survey of the first 9000 ft (Figure 1) shows that the wellbore has almost recovered to the undisturbed gradient. The deeper region (Figure 2) still shows a number of temperature depressions: the ""thief zone"" at 10250 ft, as well as the fracture zones of Experiments 2059, 2061, and 2062. The somewhat continuous temperature depression from 11,500 - 12,100 ft may be indicative of a connected system, ie Experiment 2062 stimulated much of the same region stimulated in Experiment 2059. The fracture at 12,300 ft (from Experiment 2062) is still visible but shows much more recovery than the upper region. "
Temperature Surveys in EE-3A and EE-2 and Vent Test of EE-2, May 1, 1985\1985\The EE-3A temperature survey indicates a weak hydraulic connection fran EE-2 to 11,440 feet in EE-3A which flows about 5 gpm when EE-2 is pressurized to 1700 psi and EE-3A is vented. 2. Venting of EE-2 suggests that we have irreversibly lost 1.3 million gallons of recently injected water in the thief zone. 3. Temperature surveys in EE-2 show that this zone is centered at 10,000 feet, about 1,600 feet above the casing shoe and the reservoir created during the MHF experiment 2032, when we injected 5.6 million gallons. Because most of the water now injected in EE-2 ends up in the thief zone, we have been inadequately charging the experiment 2032 reservoir that we are presently drilling EE-3A through. 
The massive hydraulic fracture of Fenton Hill HDR Well EE-3\1985\Subsequent to a 5.6 million gallon massive hydraulic fracturing (MHF) experiment in Fenton Hill Hot Dry Rock (HDR) Well EE-2, a 2 million gallon MHF was planned for Well EE-3. Although hydraulic communication between wells EE-2 and EE-3 was not established during the initial MHF, a large reservoir was created around EE-2 which seemed to be in proximity with EE-3. The objective of this 2nd MHF was two-fold, to test the reservoir and seismic characteristics of the  EE-3 openhole region from 11,390-11,700 ft and to drive fractures into the fractured region created earlier by the EE-2 MHF experiment. This paper discusses well repairs to prepare EE-3 for the MHF, the pumping operations, and injection parameters and briefly summarizes seismic results.
Thermal spallation drilling\1985\Thermal spallation drilling is an underdeveloped process with great potential for reducing the costs of drilling holes and mining shafts and tunnels in most very hard rocks. Industry has used this process to drill blast holes for emplacing explosives and to quarry granite. Some theoretical work has been performed, and many signs point to a great future for this process. The Los Alamos National Laboratory has studied the theory of the spallation process and is conducting experiments to prove out the system and to adapt it for use with a conventional rotary rig. This report describes work that has been accomplished at the Laboratory on the development of thermal spallation drilling and some work that is projected for the future on the system. 3 references, 3 figures.
Tracer and Geochemistry Analysis – Experiment 2059\1985\The appearance of sodium fluorescein dye in the EE-2 vent fluid after injection into EE-3 during Experiment 2059 is unequivocal proof that a hydraulic connection exists between the two wells. Unfortunately, the unsteady state nature of the experiment makes the calculation of an accurate value of fracture volume and effective heat transfer surface area extremely difficult. An approximate analysis using various plausible reservoir models suggests that the reservoir as it exists now is no larger than the Phase I, Run Segment 5 system. The geochemistry corroborates this conclusion, and also supplies information on the maximum reservoir temperature and possibly the wellbore entrance depth of the vent fluid before and after the connection was achieved. 
Transfer of hot dry rock technology\1985\The Hot Dry Rock Geothermal Energy Development Program has focused worldwide attention on the facts that natural heat in the upper part of the earth's crust is an essentially inexhaustible energy resource which is accessible almost everywhere, and that practical means now exist to extract useful heat from the hot rock and bring it to the earth's surface for beneficial use. The Hot Dry Rock Program has successfully constructed and operated a prototype hot, dry rock energy system that produced heat at the temperatures and rates required for large-scale space heating and many other direct uses of heat. The Program is now in the final stages of constructing a larger, hotter system potentially capable of satisfying the energy requirements of a small, commercial, electrical-generating power plant. To create and understand the behavior of such system, it has been necessary to develop or support the development of a wide variety of equipment, instruments, techniques, and analyses. Much of this innovative technology has already been transferred to the private sector and to other research and development programs, and more is continuously being made available as its usefulness is demonstrated. This report describes some of these developments and indicates where this new technology is being used or can be useful to industry, engineering, and science.
A study of pumps for the Hot Dry Rock Geothermal Energy extraction experiment (LTFT (Long Term Flow Test))\1986\A set of specifications for the hot dry rock (HDR) Phase II circulation pumping system is developed from a review of basic fluid pumping mechanics, a technical history of the HDR Phase I and Phase II pumping systems, a presentation of the results from experiment 2067 (the Initial Closed-Loop Flow Test or ICFT), and consideration of available on-site electrical power limitations at the experiment site. For the Phase II energy extraction experiment (the Long Term Flow Test or LTFT) it is necessary to provide a continuous, low maintenance, and highly efficient pumping capability for a period of twelve months at variable flowrates up to 420 gpm and at surface injection pressures up to 5000 psi. The pumping system must successfully withstand attacks by corrosive and embrittling gases, erosive chemicals and suspended solids, and fluid pressure and temperature fluctuations. In light of presently available pumping hardware and electric power supply limitations, it is recommended that positive displacement multiplex plunger pumps, driven by variable speed control electric motors, be used to provide the necessary continuous surface injection pressures and flowrates for LTFT. The decision of whether to purchase the required circulation pumping hardware or to obtain contractor provided pumping services has not been made.
Exp. 2070 data package\1986\"Briefly, a background temperature log in EE-2 was run on Dec. 3. The well was under about 80 psi and was bled to 0 psi before the temperature tool was placed in the hole. Note that the pressure went to zero, but the flow did not and it was necessary to shut the well back in during logging. The pumping started at I 0:00 am of Dec. 5th. EE-2 built to 500 psi in about 5 hrs and a shut-in temperature log was started at I 5:50. Logging continued until 22:45. Starting with the 22:35 vent the well started producing a considerable amount of gas and from that time on the turbine flow meter was reading up to twice the flow rate as was obtained by strapping the ""gold"" tank. The experiment was conducted at two different flow rates. First, 133 gpm from the start until 16:00 at which time it was reduced to 120 gpm due to pump oi 1 over-heating concerns. There are four shut-ins during the test. The first occurred at 23:55 for pump servicing. The second occurred the next morning at 8:00 again for pump servicing. The third was a short shut-in at 11: 14 while Coat 415 corrosion inhibitor was being pumped Into EE-3. Finally, the fourth was at the end of the pump at 12:30 when the inhibitor reached the bottom of the tubing string. "
Experiment 2070 procedure\1986\"Use the superpump to inject up to 0.5 million gallons of water at 3 to 4 bpm into EE-3A, through the reservoir, and then up and out EE-2. Purpose of this experiment is to assure that EE-2 is still able to flow following recent repair operations, and to determine if flow zones at 9,800 and 10,500 feet are ""stealing"" more flow. Water will be taken from EE-1 pond, and if necessary, the 5 million gallon pond, but all produced water is to be returned to EE-1 pond. The anticipated start of this experiment is Thursday, December 4, with background temperature survey taking place on December 3, and experiment duration will be 2 to 3 days. Experiment Supervisor is Jim Miller. "
Extension of two-layer fracture-systems created in hot dry rock - simulation of exp. 2059 and exp. 2062\1986\At Los Alamos National Laboratory, more than ten hydraulic fracturing experiments have been conducted to stimu1,1e a hot dry rock reservoir. Two hydraulic fracturing attempts, Exp. 2059 and Exp. 2062 , successfully established a large fracture system connecting an injection well, EE-3A, and a production well, EE-2. The Initial Closed Loop Flow Test (ICFT) is planned (from May through June, 1986) to get information on volume, impedance and temperature of the reservoir. The fracture systems created by the two experiments show characteristics that are different from ~ach other. For example, higher water pressure was required to extend fractures in Exp. 2062 than in Exp. 2059. In the ICFT, the reservoir will consist of both of the reservoirs created in Exp. 2059 and Exp. 2062. In order to understand the combined behavior, the computer code FEHM was used to simulate the new system. The parameters for the simulation are chosen to fit the experimental data. In order to obtain a good match between the simulation and the experiment, two models for fracture system are introduced. For each model, the extension of fractures is discussed. The fracture radius is predicted when water is pumped into the combined two-layer fracture systems. 
Hot Dry Rock Geothermal Energy Development Program. Annual report, fiscal year 1984\1986\The Hot Dry Rock Program in FY84 concentrated on achieving a connection between the two Phase II injection and production wells. Two massive hydraulic fracturing (MHF) experiments were conducted. The first MHF occurred in December 1983 when 21,300 m/sup 3/ (5.63 x 10/sup 6/ gal) of water were injected into well EE-2. The experiment was terminated by equipment failure, but a huge reservoir was created. The other fracturing experiment was conducted in well EE-3 when 7570 m/sup 3/ (2 x 10/sup 6/ gal) of water were injected. Neither experiment brought about a connection between the two wells. Improvements in seismic mapping techniques were notable during the year. These techniques identified the size and parameters of the big reservoir created by the MHF. Development has continued on the family of ''slimline'' downhole instruments. A ''cross-well acoustic transceiver'' has been developed for investigation of rock structures between wellbones, and chemically reactive tracers are proving useful to observe temperature changes in the system. Other related activities have included development of an analytical method for measuring radon concentration in vented gases, studies of geochemical reactions, potassium-argon dating of Fenton Hill cores and cuttings, and a laboratory study of natural convection in an inclined wellbore.
Input for experiment 2066 initial report on Packer and Dowell pumping operations. Rough draft.\1986\"The successful installation of the Exp. 2066 packer followed two unsuccessful runs using the Backer Production Technology HTHP packer, a one inch choke and the modified ""Kuster"" gage sub. The first failure is thought to have been caused by two factors: (1) An unexplained 14 ft change in drill pipe depth relative to gamma ray log depth was detected on a subsequent GR log. (2) A stand of drill pipe was left out of the frac string. These combined to cause the packer placement to be 80 ft high and the packer ruptured during inflation or un-j'ing of the expansion joint. The packer element showed clear evidence that it had been set in a fracture and the rupture had occurred where the steel backup ribs had been expanded into the near vertical fracture. The second packer was properly placed, as far as it can be determined, at a depth of 12,563 ft �5. The packer element ruptured 20 seconds after the shear plug released. Inspection of the packer showed that it had been damaged during the trip in and the element appeared to have ruptured 180� from an 1/8 inch deep two ft long cut in the inner tube. It is possible that the rupture occurred at a point where the packer element was damaged or a formation shift may have occurred when the differential pressure hit the packer. A subsequent caliper log showed a probable ledge at 10,650 ft depth and a possible hole enlargement (12,555-557 ft) at the top of the ten ft long packer seat. The geolograph chart showed a 30,000 lb. set down had occurred during run-in at 10,600 ft and ""Kuster"" charts also confirmed that a large impact had occurred somewhere below the whipstock. The packer mandrel was bent and there was imbedded rock in the bottom and side of the 7-5/8 11 inch casing on the ""Kuster"" sub. "
Migration characteristics of seismic cloud induced by hydraulic fracturing at Fenton Hill\1986\To observe the migration characteristics of seismic activities induced by the hydraulic fracturing at Fenton Hill, two kinds of figures of seismic events plots are presented. The first shows the relation between focal depth and time of occurrence. Injection well-head pressure and flow rate curves are also plotted with these plots . The second set of figures show time slices seismic event locations which consists of several location maps that represent seismic events that occurred in twelve hour intervals of time. From these figures, typical characteristics of migration of seismic activities and the close relation between well-head pressure and seismic . activity or the seismic distribution can be seen. 
My final work\1986\Hydraulic fracturing was originally developed in the late 1940s as a method of oil well stimulation. More recently, this technique has been applied to measure the in situ stress condition (e.g., Rummel and Jung, 1975; Haimson, 1978; Doe, et. al., 1983). Although the hydraulic fracturing stress measurement technique has advantages such as being applicable at great depth and in existing boreholes, it must usually be assumed that the borehole is vertical and oriented in the direction of one of the principal stresses, and in unjointed rock. If these assumptions are true, the hydraulic fracture will be created in either the vertical or horizontal planes. However, as inclined fractures have been created in some fields, the above assumptions may not always be satisfied. In a previous memorandum (Kuriyagawa et. al., 1986), we discussed our modified procedure for hydraulic fracturing stress measurements, and the method for calculating the three dimensional earth stresses from the measured data. In 1984 and 1985, we carried out mini hydraulic fracturing experiments at the Imaichi underground power plant to verify this technique (Matsunaga et. al, 1986 a, b; Sasaki et. al, 1986). In this paper, we describe the results of these experiments. 
Preliminary analysis of expt 2068, EE-2 vent\1986\"The ICFT reservoir was vented from the well EE-2 starting at 1030 hours on September 24, 1986 until 2145 hours on November 9, 1986, at which time the reservoir stopped venting fluid through EE-2 by itself. During this time a total of 1.95 - 2.6 Mgal of water was vented. The cumulative production is plotted in figures 1 and 2. The uncertainty is caused by the lack of confidence in the flow meter readding at low EE-2 pressures (Jim Thompson noted gas flow). Compared with the water loss during the ICFT of about 3,7 Mg a �1, we have recovered about 50 - 70% of the ""lost"" water. Details of the EE-2 rate, frontside (F.S.) pressure and EE-3 F.S. and backside (B.S. ) pressures are shown in figures 3 through 10 up to the 28th of October (the rest of the data is being processed). The pressure behavior is very interesting, From September 24, to October 6, EE-3 B.S. stayed constant while EE-3 F.S. went up and down with the EE-2, with about a 10 minute delay , indicating that water was flowing into EE-2 from the main fractures"" of the ICFT reservoir. Including a buoyancy pressure of lSO psi , the EE-3 F.S.-EE-2 impedance during this time was 7 - 8 psi /gpm . (This surprisingly low impedance may be indicative of the near EE-2 conditions only.) "
Results of expt. 2068\1986\A short pump into EE-3A ICFT injection zone was carried out on September 17, 1986. The data have been reported by Jim Miller (Fenton Hill Report for September 18, 1986). Figure 1 shows the 2068 data on a bottom-hole pressure vs. square root of flow rate plot, compared with the previous EE-3 A data. The 2068 pressures (indicated by stars), are significantly lower. Although the 2068 pressures had not reached steady state, the trend is significant. During this test, EE-2 pressure responded within 10 minutes to EE-3 A. The pressure rise rate EE-2 was 88 psi from 1 p.m. to 3 p.m., corresponding to a rate of 250 psi in EE-3 A for the same duration. This leads to an average rate of 1.4 psi/min. Using a reservoir volume of 0.4 Mgal (Isao Matsunaga, personal communication) we get a compressibility of 2 x ,o-4 /psi. This is consistent with a fracture compressibility at an effective confining stress of 4900 psi (t3=1 /P.). This leads to the interpretation that we were inflating the entire ICFT reservoir during 2068. Figure 2, prepared by Isao Matsunaga, shows the various EE-3 A shut-ins during the ICFT compared to 2068 on a normalized scale. The behavior is consistent, implying leak off rates that scale with the pressure. 
Sidetrack and re-drill of EE-2\1986\"The following is a summary plan to sidetrack and re-drill EE-2 should we need to actually sidetrack following last week's unsuccessful repair attempts. The plan, aims to achieve the 3 major objectives of the previous EE-2 repair plan, which are: (1) improve pressure integrity of wellbore, (2) provide an open wellbore to a depth of 12,500 ft, and (3) establish a wireline logging capability through the reservoir. In addition, the possibility of improving the flow potential of the wellbore will be considerably improved. This early plan assumes that the trajectory of sidetracked EE-2, now designated a EE-2A, will be planned to minimize the additional costs associated with complex directional drilling. It also assumes that a whipstock will be set deep (10,400' ); one or two motor runs will be required to direct the EE-2A course away form EE-2; and the remaining trajectory will be controlled with directional rotary drilling assemblies. Openhole evaluation will be accomplished primarily with geothermal mud logging during drilling. Time and money for two open hole packer runs with fresh water stimulation are included. Most openhole logging requirements can be accomplished with ESS-6. A large savings in rig time could result if an openhole gamma ray-caliper combination tool can be developed by ESS-6 or purchased (Schlumberger is a potential source). Commercial wireline services could further be reduced if a through-the-drill pipe gamma ray-collar locator (2-1/8"" OD) tool can be developed. Due to the expected budget limitations no coring runs are included. For now it is assumed that EE-2A will be completed using the same equipment that was purchased to run on the 7"" liner for the EE-2 repair (see Proposed Procedure for EE-2 Repair, ESS-4-86-149 revision, Nov. 13, 1986). A few minor changes will need to be made. The 5-1/2"" tubing pulled from EE-2 during the recent repair attempt is in excellent condition and can be rerun. However there are 33 pins or boxes that will need to be recut. "
Simulation of experiment 2062\1986\"The Exp. 2062 reservoir will be important to the final Phase II flow loop, so an effort to model the experiment and post Exp. 2062 temperature logs was made. The FEHM code was used to simulate the experiment. The reservoir was modeled using a 2-D radial mesh with a ""thief zone"" at 3125 m (10,252 1 ) and reservoir fractures at 3600 m (11,811 1 ), 3660 m (12,008'), 3690 m (12,106 1), and 3750 m (12,3030'). Fracture apertures in the reservoir were assumed to be 1 mm with the exception of the fracture at 3660 m which was taken to be 2.5 mm. A schematic of the reservoir model is shown in Figure 1. The ""thief zone"" covered about 25 m. A post-experiment temperature survey, July 25, 1985 (Figure 2c), was used as a guide for matching flow splits and fracture permeability. However there were some problems obtaining the various matches. The extrapolated original background temperature (Figure 2a) used for estimating initial rock conditions did not take into account the near wellbore heating and cooling that resulted from the injection and venting during previous packer experiments. A pre-test temperature survey, July 10, 1985 (Figure 2b), indicated the wellbore was heated as much as 75�C (near the surface) above background temperatures above 2985 m (9,793 1 ) and was cooled up to 40�C below that depth. Additional temperature recovery between July 10 and the start of the experiment on July 18 would effect this deviation from background only slightly. "
Symposium on high-temperature well-logging instrumentation\1986\The Earth Science Instrumentation Group at the Los Laboratory is developing borehole logging that can withstand downhole temperatures in and pressures greater than 103 MPa (15 000 The group was formed in 1973 to provide geophysical measurements supporting the Hot Dry Rock (HDR) Geothermal Project at Fenton Hill, New Mexico. The HDR Project needed high-temperature materials, components, transducers, and instrumentation for borehole logging tools for its drilling, hydraulic fracturing, and acoustic fracture-mapping programs. In some instances Los Alamos contracted with private industry and other commercial organizations to develop the equipment required for the operations at Fenton Hill. Now numerous Department of Energy and private industry programs other than the HDR Project are using this equipment. The purpose of the symposium was to inform interested persons from industry, government, and universities of these successful developments in high-temperature well-logging instrumentation. Many individuals and organizations in the private sector and the Department of Energy contributed to the success of the symposium. We deeply appreciate their support. The abstracts in this report were prepared for presentation at the symposium. 
A tracer-based model for heat transfer in a hot dry rock reservoir\1987\A model for heat transfer in a Hot Dry Rock (HDR) geothermal reservoir is developed which predicts produced fluid thermal performance based on the tracer-determined residence time distribution and an estimated value of fracture porosity. The tracer response is modeled as flow through several paths of highly fractured rock. Fracture porosity is used to convert fluid volumes to rock volumes, which is necessary to model the heat sweep. The produced fluid response is the mixing cup average of the individual path temperatures. The model adequately represents the measured thermal response of an HDR reservoir operated at the Fenton Hill NM HDR geothermal site in the late 1970's. Application to the current Fenton Hill reservoir predicts a rapid initial thermal drawdown of about 50/sup 0/C, followed by a very slow thermal decline thereafter. The model is most sensitive to fracture porosity, and less so to the flow path geometry used to match the tracer response.
Application of the three point method to experiment 2032: Results\1987\The three point method is a method that I have developed over the past year for looking for patterns (planes) in the microearthquake location data collected during hydraulic fracturing experiments. I have prepared a complete paper for publication (in the Journal of Geophysical Research) that describes the method and the results of applying the method to data collected during experiment 2032 (THE MHF). I distributed a preliminary version of this paper to some of you. The paper has been reviewed by the Journal and the reviewers suggested many helpful improvements which I have now made (both in the paper and some modifications to the method). The paper is now modified. I will be happy to provide the current version of the paper to anyone who wants it but am not distributing it to everyone since it would require lots of trees to lose their lives. This memo is a summary of the results of applying the method to experiment 2032 and avoids all the detail of how I got the results to be presented. I hope that this memo will generate discussion of the usefulness of the method as applied to hydraulic fracturing data. 
Applications of a downhole programmable microprocessor for a geothermal borehole inspection tool\1987\The high-temperature scanning borehole inspection system is currently being developed jointly by the Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) and Westfalische Berggewerkschaftskasse (WBK) of West Germany. The downhole instrument is a digital televiewer that utilized a microprocessor to digitize, process and transmit the acoustic information to the surface acquisition and control system. The primary operation of the downhole acoustic assembly uses a piezoelectric crystal acting as a receiver-transmitter which is mounted on the rotating head. The crystal emits a burst of acoustic energy that propagates through the borehole fluid with a portion of the energy reflected by the borehole wall back to the crystal. The time of travel and the amplitude of the reflected signal are conditioned by the microprocessor and transmitted along with other pertinent data to the surface data processing center. This instrument has been designed specifically for use in geothermal borehole environments to determine the location of fractures intersecting the borehole and provide information concerning overall borehole conditions. It may also be used for definitive casing inspection. The instrument essentially eliminates operator interaction for downhole control and simplifies assembly and maintenance procedures.
Data for reports required for Fenton Hill discharge plan\1987\The water vented from the geothermal wells has remained in the service pond and the 5 million gallon reservoir since starting venting in May '85. In general the service pond has been full or partially full during that period. it is full at the time of this memorandum. Once during the period since May '85 a discharge from the service pond in the amount of 2,163,000 gal. was made in accordance with our NPDES permit. This discharge took place during the months of Aug., Sept., Oct., Nov., and Dec., 1986. There have been no accidental spills or leaks during the reporting period. On 5 Sept., 1985 somewhat less than 1,000,000 gallons of water was transferred from the service pond to the 5 million gal. reservoir. Table II shows the average concentrations of various ions plus averages of the pH, the conductivity, the pH, the total dissolved solids, and the total suspended solids in the water vented from the geothermal wells into the service pond. These averages cover analyses made from July 1985 through Dec., 1986. 
Determining planes along which earthquakes occur: method and application to earthquakes accompanying hydraulic fracturing\1987\Although it is generally accepted that earthquakes occur along preexisting faults, the distribution of earthquake locations is often so smeared that the underlying fault or joint structures along which the earthquakes occur cannot be inferred from visual inspection of location plots. We present a statistical method for identifying fault or joint planes within what may otherwise appear to be an amorphous earthquake location set. The method takes all the hypocenters in an event set three at a time in order to determine the strikes and dips of all possible planes within the event set. A procedure for correcting for the shape of the region in which the earthquakes occur is applied. After correction, the orientation (one or a few) that is seen most often is taken as that of the zone of preexisting fault(s) or joint(s). We applied the method to a set of hypocenters determined for microearthquakes that accompanied a hydraulic injection into crystalline rock. The method was able to resolve successively five statistically significant orientations (planes) along which most of the microearthquakes occurred. The first two planes determined by the method are parallel to one nodal plane from each of the two most commonly found fault plane solutions. One of the two planes intersects the injection well bore at a location where water is known to have entered the rock during the injection. The planes identified thus coincide with the major fluid paths during the hydraulic injection.
Developing hot dry rock reservoirs with inflatable open hole packers\1987\An open hole packer system was designed for high pressure injection operations in high temperature wells at the Fenton Hill, Hot Dry Rock (HOR) Geothermal Site. The packer runs were required to verify that the HOR reservoir fractures had been penetrated during the drilling of well EE-3A. They were also used to stimulate fractures connecting EE-3A to the reservoir and to conduct two massive hydraulic fracture treatments at the bottom of EE-3A. An attempt to use a modified packer design as a temporary well completion system was not successful but with modification the system may prove to be an important HOR completion technique. The eleven packer runs have demonstrated that formation testing, stimulation and HOR reservoir development can now be conducted with an open hole inflatable packer operating over large temperature ranges and high differential pressures. 
EE2A Redrilling plan - preliminary draft\1987\"In November, 1986 Big Chief Rig #47 was activated to begin workover operations on EE-2. The primary objectives were to improve pressure integrity of the wellbore to provide reservoir analysis capability and to reduce near wellbore fluid losses by cementing the 9,800' zone. During the workover operations~ it was determined that the 9 5/8 in. casing was collapsed at 10,512 ft. It had collapsed below the casing packer which had been set at 10,400 ft. A section of 7 in. casing, a conduit which had been used to guide logging tools, extended from below the packer to the top of the cut off 5 1/2 in. tubing fish at 10,720 ft. The 7 in. casing was also collapsed at 10,512' inside the 9 5/8 in. casing. The tubing and packer above the collapse were recovered and found to be in good condition. Two Joints of 7"" conduit were recovered after pulling the collapsed pin out of the collar on the third Joint. Several unsuccessful attempts were made at milling through the collapsed area back into the 7'' conduit before operations were suspended. It was concluded that the 9 5/8 in. casing was also collapsed at 10,512 ft. Three options for EE-2 have been evaluated: (1) Conduct the Long Term Flow Test (LTFT> with EE-2 in its present condition. This is proposed as the least risk, lowest cost option. A 5 1/211 tubing string, expansion Joint and packer are tentatively proposed for the completion of EE-2. A procedure to protect the 9 5/8 in. casing from further deterioration during the LTFT has been prepared. (2) Mill and fish through the collapsed region in EE-2, and if successful, continue the November, 1986 repair plan. This is proposed as the highest risk and least desirable option. No planning or procedure for this option has been prepared. (3) Sidetrack and redrill EE-2A from above the collapsed zone in EE-2. This is proposed as a moderate risk, high cost, but most technically desirable option. Outlined below are the procedures and plans prepared to conduct a redrilling operation in EE-2. "
Experiment 2074: post-drilling reservoir flow testing through EE-3A first revision\1987\"As previously outlined in memorandum ESS-4-87-305 (11/12/87), EE-3A will be pressurized with the Kobe pumps for the next week, and then a sequence of reservoir flow tests and logs will be conducted for a one to two week period beginning Tuesday, 12/1/87. The purpose of this memorandum is to better define this flow test and sequence of logs, organized as a ""formal"" experiment. "
Geochemistry during the redrilling of EE-2A (9800-11000 FT)\1987\Using downhole water samples and drilling fluid samples, we interpret the nature of flow in the reservoir during drilling from 9800 - 11000 ft. Geothermometer readings from the downhole water samples suggest that the EE-2A flow is fluid which was pumped from EE-3A. A mixing model for nonadsorbing chemical species in the drilling fluid predicts a major inflow at 10940 ft, smaller, equal flows at 10800 and 10840 ft, and possibly a small flow at 10720 ft. 
Geological structures from televiewer logs of GT-2, Fenton Hill, New Mexico: Part 1, Feature extraction\1987\Patterns in reflected sonic intensity recognized during examination of televiewer logs of basement gneiss at the Hot Dry Rock Site, Fenton Hill, New Mexico, are due to geological fractures and foliations and to incipient breakouts. These features are obscured by artifacts caused by wellbore ellipticity, tool off-centering, and tool oscillations. An interactive method, developed for extraction of the structural features (fractures and foliations), uses human perception as a pattern detector and a chi-square test of harmonic form as a pattern discriminator. From imagery of GT-2, 733 structures were recovered. The acceptance rate of the discriminator was 54%. Despite these positive results, the general conclusion of this study is that intensity-mode imagery from Fenton Hill is not directly invertible for geological information because of the complexity of the televiewer imaging process. Developing a forward model of the intensity-imaging process, or converting to caliper-mode imagery, or doing both, will be necessary for high-fidelity feature extraction from televiewer data.
Geological structures from televiewer logs of GT-2, Fenton Hill, New Mexico: Part 2, Rectification\1987\Televiewer logs from drill hole GT-2 at the Fenton Hill, New Mexico, Hot Dry Rock Site, have been rectified by conversion of structural traces on the scanner imagery to geographic location and orientation. The rectification method was direct inversion that consisted of mapping from the image to the wellbore, inverting the trace on the wellbore for principal points, and rotating from wellbore to geographic coordinates. From the test imagery of GT-2, 733 structures (fractures and foliations) were measured, compared with 42 structures from recovered core. The 733 new measurements listed in this report are a unique and unrepeatable collection of structural information from the Precambrian basement of northern New Mexico. This direct inversion method is accurate where the magnetic field vector is constant and the tool is centered and aligned in a circular wellbore. In other cases this method yields only approximate results.
Geological structures from televiewer logs of GT-2, Fenton Hill, New Mexico: Part 3, Quality control\1987\A procedure has been developed for extracting geological structures from paper prints of intensity-mode televiewer logs. It was applied to old logs of drill hole GT-2 at the Fenton Hill, New Mexico, Hot Dry Rock Site. A series of tests have also been developed for measuring the resultant data quality, and this report describes these tests and applies them to evaluate the procedure. A test for measurement accuracy shows that locations were measured to better than 0.1 ft and orientations to within 1/sup 0/. The root-mean-square error in fitting a trace rarely exceeded 0.2 ft. The second set of tests, for reproducibility, measures the amount of association between two different runs of the same length of hole, in this case a distance of 275 ft. Two new measures of association are defined, termed coplanarity and collinearity. The lack of any recurrences requires explanation and leads to a third set of tests, for repetition rate. The low repetition rate is explained by random errors in location and orientation, which are different on each run. A fourth set of tests consists of fitting a model of the feature-extraction process to the data and estimating data reliability from quality parameters of the model. A perception model yielded an estimate of data quality at 91.5%.
Hydraulic and Thermal Behavior of a Hot Dry Rock Reservoir during a 30-Day Circulation Test\1987\Testing has been in progress since January 1985 in the second hot Dry Rock reservoir located at Fenton Hill, New Mexico. The results of a 30-day circulation test, conducted in 1986, are reported. The nominal reservoir depth is 3,650. And the mean in situ temperature of the reservoir is 245C. During the test 37,000m3 of cold water was injected into the reservoir and hot water was recovered at temperatures ranging up to 192C. This corresponded to a maximum thermal power output of about 10MW.
Identification of MHF (massive hydraulic fracturing) fracture planes and flow paths: A correlation of well log data with patterns in locations of induced seismicity\1987\One of the critical steps in developing a hot dry rock geothermal system is the creation of flow paths through the rock between two wellbores. To date, circulation systems have only been created by drilling one wellbore, hydraulically fracturing the well (which induces microearthquakes), locating the microearthquakes and then drilling a second wellbore through the zone of seismicity. A technique for analyzing the pattern of seismicity to determine where fracture planes are located in the seismically active region has recently been developed. This allows us to distinguish portions of the seismically active volume which are most likely to contain significant flow paths. We applied this technique to seismic data collected during a massive hydraulic fracturing (MHF) treatment and found that the fracture planes determined by the seismic method are confirmed by borehole temperature and caliper logs which indicate where permeable fractures and/or zones of weakness intersect the wellbores. A geometric model based on these planes and well log data has enhanced our understanding of the reservoir flow paths created by fracturing and is consistent with results obtained during production testing of the reservoir.
Locating microearthquakes induced by hydraulic fracturing in crystalline rock\1987\Microearthquakes induced by hydraulic fracturing in crystalline rock at a depth of 3.5 km were located with a precision of better than 30 m to obtain information about the geometry and dimensions of the fracture system produced. The induced microseismicity was monitored by a network of five borehole seismic stations; a total of about 800 induced events were reliably located from arrival times. Event locations show a tabular distribution that strikes 350 degrees and dips 65 degrees east, subparallel to the injection well. The injection was intended to produce a fracture system that would hydraulically connect two subparallel wells. A lack of fluid communication between them is consistent with a lack of induced microearthquakes near the target wellbore. The 150 m thickness of the zone of seismicity far exceeds the relative locational uncertainties. The injected fluid appears to have stimulated a zone of rock, rather than simply a single fracture.--Modified journal abstract.
Locations of microseismic events for experiment 2066\1987\"Experiment 2065 was the last ""packer test"" that was conducted during the EE-3a redrilling phase. It was conducted in late January and early February of 1986. It was the first experiment where the MASSCOMP/RAVEN seismic data acquisition system was employed and as such represents our best recorded hydraulic fracturing experiment. Since this experiment was so well recorded we decided to locate all the events that we recorded. This has taken some time (interrupted by the ICFT and subsequent analysis of that data). We are finally done locating all of these events and this memo presents the data. A total of 2060 events were located from this experiment. Of these events, 1941 were quality A and 41 were quality B. The remainder were below quality B which means that locations are not reliable. For comparison, using the old biomation scheme, we found 844 quality A and B locations for all of experiment 2032 in spite of the fact that 2032 was a much more seismically active experiment. Figure 1 shows three views of the locations obtained. The events occurred generally to the south and deeper than the 2032 seismicity, shown in Figure 2. There is a great deal of overlap between the two seismic zones in the region of the seismic 'knot', which was one of the targets for redrilling of EE-3A. Fehler is currently applying the three point method to this data. Further interpretation of this seismicity will await the results of this work. This experiment is particularly interesting because it occurs at a location where there is a transition from 2032 style seismicity, which is rather diffuse and along multiple planes as defined by the three point method, and deeper type of seismicity, such as that during 2042 and 2061, where a much greater seismic energy release occurred per unit injected volume and the seismicity seemed to follow along fractures trending in one direction. "
Meeting of the target and trajectory working group of the EE-2A redrilling committee\1987\The target/trajectory working group met on April 7 and were presented the very preliminary results of the application of the 3 point method Exp. 2032 planes to the target section process. 
Outline of the long term flow test (LTFT)\1987\As previously stated, the overall objective of the LTFT must be to understand as much as possible the Phase II reservoir, and to be able to convince our sponsors and/or some segment of the energy/utility industry that HDR is a viable technology. 
Redrilling of well EE-3 at the Los Alamos National Laboratory HDR (Hot Dry Rock) project\1987\The successful sidetracking of well EE-3 and the drilling of well EE-3A proved that with detailed planning and by adjusting techniques based on previous experience at Fenton Hill, drilling can be accomplished with reduced risk. The primary drilling problems associated with drilling of hot, crystalline basement rock, are (a) abrasiveness between the downhole tools and the formations and (b) a crooked wellbore path. These were essentially eliminated by a specially designed drilling fluid and careful pre-planning of the directional drilling operations. These improvements have taken much of the risk out of drilling at the Fenton Hill Hot Dry Rock (HDR) Geothermal Test Site. The sidetracking of EE-3 and drilling of EE-3A were undertaken to complete the hydraulic connection between boreholes. Drilling through fractured regions indicated by the dense zones of microseismic activity increased the probability of success. EE-3 was sidetracked at 9373' and redrilled to a depth of 13,182'.
Reservoir impedances before and after redrilling\1987\"The question of wellbore interference has arisen during the discussion surrounding target selection for EE-2A. Simply stated, we are interested in knowing what, if any, effect the old EE-2 wellbore will have on production from the redrilled well, EE-2A. Our results indicate that regardless of the location of EE-2A, unless EE-2 can be fully plugged with cement, there will be some flow into the former EE-2 production region. At the present time, there are two targets under consideration for the redrill of EE-2A. The ""close-in"" target will have a production zone located about 15 m (49 ft) farther away from EE-3A than EE-2 now lies. The ""step-out"" target adds about 100 m (328 ft) in distance as shown here "
Reservoir modles\1987\The project to match the pressure response seen at EE-3A during the final shut-in of the ICFT initially began as an attempt to solve a mass-balance equation for an inflated, penny-shaped planar fracture during shut-in. Implicit assumptions include no flow along the fracture, no fracture extension after shut-in, constant fracture length and a homogeneous rock mass with constant permeability surrounding the fracture. The resulting expression equates the fluid volume permeating into the rock (as described in reference 1) to the change in volume of the fracture as it deflates during shut-in 
Reservoir pressurization during the redrilling of EE-2A: Expt. 2073\1987\During the redrilling of EE-2A through the Phase II reservoir region, the reservoir will be pressurized through EE-3A to provide flow connection information. Primarily, we will be looking for indications of fracture intersections during redrilling as shown by: An increased drilling fluid outflow relative to the mud pump circulating rate A pressure response at EE-3A A sudden increase in evolved CO2 from the drilling fluid A change in the wellbore temperature profile indicating a significant reservoir flow into EE-2A To provide clear diagnostic information, the Phase II reservoir region needs to be maintained at a significant pressure -- of the order of 2000 psi. The alternative would be to maintain a low reservoir pressure with only weepy flows into EE-2A, poor diagnostics, and the probable need for confirming packer flow tests. During this experiment, additional reservoir information can be obtained by monitoring the shutin pressure response at EE-2A and at EE-3A. This would be done by first measuring the shutin pressure response at EE-2A while continuing to pressurize EE-3A, and then by pumping into EE-2A with EE-3A temporarily shut in. The obvious EE-2A fracture zones to be tested in this way are the low-pressure fluid loss zone at 9800 feet, and the inferred high-pressure fracture intersection at 10,750 feet. 
Revised plans for Hot Dry Rock geothermal program\1987\This letter is our response to your February 13 letter directing us to respond to Headquarters' request for new HDR program plans. This request was initiated by John E. Mock, CE-342, HQ. Our response is organized as three attachments. Attachment A provides four program plans, which range from one that accommodates the President's budget request to one which assumes that the originally expected funding profile prevails. Also included in Attachment A is a very brief history of the HDR program, a digest of external reviews of the program which attest to its technical excellence, a presentation of the major remaining objectives of the program, and a discussion of whether to sidetrack and redrill EE-2, or effect an inexpensive, but limited repair. Attachment B provides specific answers to the management issues raised by Dr. Mock, and Attachment C provides answers to his technical issues. In closing, John Whetten and Mike Berger join me in thanking you for the opportunity you afforded us to discuss HDR with you on February 23. We also wish to convey to you our thanks for the assistance provided by Dr. Carlos Garcia and Mr. George Tennyson. Their sincere interest in our program, exhibited by their numerous visits to Los Alamos and Fenton Hill, and their guidance and advice sustain our enthusiasm for the HDR program, and are greatly appreciated. 
Reworking of 2032 seismic data: results from begining of experiment to 12/7:02:30 (first 10 hours of pumping)\1987\We have been reanalyzing the 2032 seismicity using data digitized from analog tapes onto the Masscomp system. During the entire experiment, approximately 2000 events were digitized and stored on the old HP- Biomation system. This system was capable of recording events at a rate of approximately one per minute. The events chosen for storage were hand selected which leaves the likelihood of bias in the event selection. Moreover, we have found a number of cases of two or more events occurring during the span, of a few seconds. The HP-Biomation system would have been triggered by the first event and would not have recorded the subsequent events. Digitizing onto the Masscomp system is more objective since the event parameters are set and maintained nearly constant for the duration of the digitizing process (parameters were changed during time periods when the EE-1 geophone was not operating). The Masscomp system can trigger at a rate of up to once per second. Since a large quantity of data are stored for each event. two or more events occurring during a few seconds time are often recorded and stored. The event parameters were chosen to be as close as possible to those used during experiments 2066 and 2067 when nearly all locatable seismic events were detected and stored. The selection of the parameters was made somewhat complicated by the fact that downhole data were recorded on two separate tapes at all times. We had to digitize two times to get all downhole data. Since two streams of data were digitized separately, we then had to correlate events between the two streams of data. (For a description of digitizing parameters, see memo from House to Fehler dated January 15, 1987.) Approximately 16,000 events were detected on both streams of data by the Masscomp system during the digitizing process that could be correlated to the same actual experiment time .We have now begun to locate these events.
Testimony for the Hot Dry Rock geothermal energy program to the United States House of Representatives, Committee on Science and Technology, Subcommittee on Energy Development and Applications\1987\Strong interest in proceeding with the construction of commercial scale hot dry rock systems has already been expressed within the United States and other countries. The possibility of undertaking such a project has been discussed with representatives of the California Energy Commission, the State of Utah, and the New York Energy Research and Development Authority. Japan also believes that hot dry rock systems can be important both there and throughout the Pacific Basin. A research program exists in Great Britain and there are smaller, complementary programs in several other countries. A report in the technical press states that three hot dry rock projects are being undertaken in the Soviet Union. The magnitude and potential contribution of the hot dry rock energy resource is now being recognized domestically and internationally. The US Hot Dry Rock Program is the broadest, most ambitious, and most advanced in the world. We sincerely appreciate the support this committee has given the technology in the past, and hope that this support can be continued so that hot, dry rock can soon be used to improve our energy security. 
The return of the new wellbore trajectory\1987\Now that drilling is completed, here is a second and final update on the location of the new wellbore, EE-2A. There are two sets of wellbore locations; one generated by a series of single-shot surveys taken throughout drilling, and one generated after we reached bottom-hole and set off a multi-shot survey. It's difficult to say which survey is more believable, so suffice it to say that they are both in pretty close agreement. How close is pretty close? Figure 1 shows the two surveys to be within at least 20 feet of one another, which is less than the estimated error for each individual location. Also, Figure 2 shows the separation distances to wells EE-2 and EE-3A to be approximately the same for both surveys. Having resolved that issue, Figure 3 shows EE-2A in relation to EE-2, EE-3, and EE-3A (in case you're wondering, the EE-2A trajectory is the one determined from the multi-shot survey). Figure 4 shows orthogonal views of six of the three-point planes. These six were chosen since they are thought to be those most likely to flow. Each small dot on the planes identifies the location of a microseismic event associated with that plane (i.e. the event occurs within 10 meters of either side of the plane). Also shown are locations on the plane where wellbores intersect the plane. Due to the 10 meter error in plane location, the wells could intersect the planes at a number of points (an infinite number, in fact). 'What is shown is a line drawn along the face of the plane, indicating all the locations on that plane where each particular wellbore might intersect. The X's on either end of the lines mark where the wells will intersect given the 10 meter error on either side of the plane. The X in the middle of the lines show where the wells intersect the planes if there is no error in location. On Plane 2032.1.A, the lines for wells EE-3 and EE-3A don't have X's in the middle. This is because these wells only intersect this plane if it is offset from its original location. Finally, Tables I and II list the range of depths along each wellbore where each plane. might be encountered, given the 10 m error. - Listed are the - minimum, projected (where the three-point method predicts intersection), and maximum depths along each wellbore where each �plane could intercept, along with the total length of wellbore where the intersection may occur. Notice how there is a great deal of error in the location of Plane Al in EE-2A (anywhere along 824' of wellbore). This is because the angle between the plane and the wellbore is very small (5�). One highlight to result from this analysis is that the two major injection regions in EE-3A during ICFT (as indicated by temperature logs) can be correlated with seismic planes. 
Advancements in thermal spallation drilling technology\1988\Thermal spallation of hard rocks has been used commercially for many years to cut granite in quarries and to produce blasting holes in taconite mines. It is potentially an economic process for creating cavities in hard rocks that are difficult to drill or mine by conventional methods. These cavities might have application for storage of liquids and gases and of energy in several forms. They may also be used as high-pressure, naturally heated retorts for certain chemical processes. This report describes the spallation process, including the fluid dynamics and heat transfer from flame jets to the rock and subsequent rock failure. Our model of the spallation process predicts with good accuracy the surface temperatures and heat-transfer rates required to maintain desired drilling rates. Field tests, including site selection, equipment, field operations, and accomplishments, are also described in detail. 31 refs., 13 figs., 1 tab.
Experiment 2074 Report\1988\The damaged EE-2 production wellbore at the Fenton Hill Hot Dry Rock (HOR) site was sidetracked and redrilled in October and November of 1987, resulting in the new wellbore EE-2A. A 7-day flow test was conducted to determine the post-drilling condition of EE-2A; the proper depth for a cemented liner to be installed in the open hole; the effect of redrilling on the reservoir flow paths; production temperatures, impedance and water loss; and the need for reservoir stimulation through the new wellbore. In addition to assessing the effects of the redrilling of EE-2A, there was a second overall objective for Experiment 2074: to better understand the cause of the anomalously low EE-3A injection pressures during Experiment 2070 when compared to the previously-conducted ICFT. To satisfy this objective, injection flow rates comparable to those during Experiment 2070 were used and the pumping duration was increased from 26 hours to 7 days . . The experiment began with a brief injection (at about 30 gpm) into EE-2A on December 1, 1987 from 1130 to 1800 hrs with a short shut-in from 1330 to 1430 hrs, to provide a pressurized cement bond log. The log showed that the annular cementing operation, that started at 6500 ft, had extended up to 2400 ft. Overall bonding was much better than expected. However, bonding was poor between the old cement below 6500 ft and the new cement and poor bonding or free pipe exists in two 20 ft sections at about 5300 ft. The bond obtained over the squeeze-cemented interval of 9500 to 9200 ft was poor. Apparently, the cement entered a fracture near the squeeze perforations at 9500 ft and little cement was placed in the 9-5/8 inch casing annulus above this point. 
Experiment 2076 Report\1988\The purpose of Experiment 2076 was to test the well completion in EE-2A by stressing the well to the worst-case conditions. The worst case was considered to be a surface pressure of 5000 psi and thermal stresses corresponding to full cooldown in the well. A secondary objective of this experiment was to provide an initial stimulation of the joints intersecting EE-2A which had previously been exposed to a maximum of 1500 psi. Injection began at 1600 hrs on June 16, 1988. Pumping capacity of up to 15.5 bpm was provided by BJ-Hughes Services. The injection flow rate, injection pressure, and injection temperature were recorded. At EE-3A, which was shut-in, the wellhead pressure and backside vent rate were recorded. Seismicity was monitored using the Precambrian net (GT- I, PC- I, and PC-2) and the 3-axis geophone sonde in EE- I . Continuous and Kuster temperature logs were conducted before and after the flow test. 
Experiment 2076: Post-Completion Pressure Testing of EE-2A\1988\The purpose of this memorandum is to present a formal plan for the pressure testing of the EE-2A completion. prior to releasing the drill rig. As presently planned. this pressure testing will he done with the BOP stack in place, which necessarily limits our surface injection pressure at EE-2A to 5000 psi. 
HDR Report to Senate\1988\"Following Dr. John E. Hock's directive of October 9, 1987, and in accordance with the guidance received in Washington on January 11th, we are providing the attached report. We believe it should serve as the basis for the Department's response to the Senate Energy Committee's request for a long-term plan for HDR development. The Committee requested that the ""Department should advise the Committee within six months as to whether the effort at Fenton Hill should be continued or phased down. If it is recommended for continuation, a funding profile to accomplish the Long-Term Flow Test should be provided to the Committee as soon as possible."" The Committee also directed the Department to address the recommendation of the Energy Research Advisory Board. The information provided in the report responds to these requirements. In adhering to the approach agreed upon in Washington, that Los Alamos would write a report that the Department could use directly, we have presumed in the text to be speaking for the Department. As instructed, we have added a nominal inflation, 4.3%, and incorporated revised, more conservative estimates of the cost of securing the Fenton Hill wells and facilities following the Long-Term Flow Test. For the Department's convenience, we have also attached a cover letter written in Dr. Hock's name which he may wish to use to summarize the report's recommendations. "
Incorporating Uncoupled Stress Effects into FEHM Modeling of HDR Reservoirs\1988\Thermal and pressure-induced stress effects are extremely important aspects of modeling HOR reservoirs because these effects will control the transient behavior of reservoir flow impedance, water loss and flow distribution. Uncoupled stress effects will be added to the existing three-dimensional Finite Element Heat and Mass Transfer (FEHH) model (Birdsell, 1988) in order to more realistically simulate HOR reservoirs. Stress effects will be uncoupled in the new model since a fully-coupled code will not be available for some time. 
Post Expt. 2074 Temperature Log in EE-2A\1988\During the latter part of Expt. 2074, the EE-3A annulus above the cemented-in liner -- between the 4- I /2-in tubing and the 9-5/8-in casing -- began to now, with this outflow increasing to about 5-1 /2 gpm near the end of this experiment. Although the available evidence strongly suggests that the annular flow was coming from the high-pressure Phase II reservoir through a fracture network that bypasses the cemented-in liner in EE-3A, this conclusion needed to be verified by a temperature (with collar locator) log. This log was run on Jan. 21, 1988, 44 days following the end of the pumping phase of Expt. 2074. 
Preliminary Interpretation of EE-2A Televiewer Log\1988\It appears that there is a non-flowing hydrofracture from 10 200 to I 0 285 ft; the features that are prime candidates for flowing fractures all appear to be quasi-horizontal. These results are at variance with expectations. 
Procedure to Complete EE-2A\1988\Well EE-2A was side-tracked off of a whipstock (AZ International Packstop ) set at 9,748 ft.* within a section milled in the 9-5/8 in. casing from 9,688 ft. to 9,748 ft. The well was then directionally drilled to 12,360 ft. A number of in-flow zones from well EE-3A have been determined. The shallowest in-flow zone occurs at approximately 10,800 ft. For long-term production testing of the well, a 7 in. OD liner will be run from approximately 10,755 ft. to about 9,450 ft. Then a 7 in. tie-back string will be run from the top of the liner to the surface. Prior to running the liner, the open hole below the liner will be plugged to facilitate running and cementing the liner, the top of the liner will be cleaned out and made ready to accept the tieback steam. The tieback will then be run and cemented. The tieback and the liner will be drilled out. The sand in the open hole will be cleaned out to total depth while pumping into EE-3A with the superpump. A 4-8 hour 6,000 psi injection down the 7 in. casing will be conducted to test the final well completion and to stimulate fractures in the open hole production interval. The pump may be proceeded or followed by temperature log and cement bond log. The wellhead equipment will be installed ant the rig released.
Supercritical Water Oxidation of Organic Waste in an In-Ground Reactor\1988\Modeling of a conceptual in-ground reactor for destroying toxic organic wastes is reported in this memo. The modeling problem was to solve for the pressure and temperature profiles in an in-ground reactor designed to destroy organic wastes by oxidation in supercritical water. The reactor design consists of 4 annuli, a downcomer and upcomer for the waste stream and oxygen, and a downcomer and upcomer for cooling water. The reaction takes place at supercritical conditions (P>3200 psi and T>374�C) at the bottom of the wellbore. Two-phase-flow heat transfer, pressure drop, and hydrodynamic correlations were incorporated into a finite difference model for wellbore heat transfer and fluid flow. Design calculations were carried out to obtain preliminary values for the optimum reactor design parameters (depth, wellbore diameter, etc.) for a typical organic waste in water. Then an economic analysis was done to estimate capital and operating costs. For comparison, a parallel study was performed by Bob McFarland, MEE- 13, for a surface reactor design. The original idea behind the in-ground reactor concept was that pumping and compression costs could be reduced by providing pressure via the hydrostatic head of water. The tradeoff would be these savings against the greater capital costs of drilling and completing the wellbore. However, it was shown that for significant savings in operating costs to be achieved, one would have to drill to extremely large depths (5 km or greater), and that the savings would be more than offset by the increased drilling and completion costs. However, the inground reactor concept may still be economical when compared to the surface reactor systems studied because the in-ground unit can potentially handle a greater waste stream flow rate. The optimum design is therefore at shallow depths of less than 1000 m and waste stream flow rates of 200 gpm or greater. This analysis suggests that the most likely application for the in-ground reactor is for destroying organic contaminants in aquifers, for which large volumes of water must be treated. A conceptual design for a combined fluid production well/supercritical oxidation reactor was developed for this application. Future work on in-ground supercritical water oxidation reactors should focus on this new proposed design. 
Televiewer measurement of in-situ stress direction at the Fenton Hill Hot Dry Rock Site, New Mexico\1988\The in situ stresses at Fenton Hill has been determined in drill hole EE-3A by observations of wellbore breakouts on imagery obtained with a televiewer logging tool. Wellbore shape, tool offcentering, and tool misalignment cause geometric distortions which have been treated by comparing imagery from two logging runs made six months apart. The comparison establishes that wellbore degradation in drill hole EE-3A is due to breakouts, which grow larger with time. The azimuth of the axis of minimum horizontal principal stress is estimated to be 110.7 +//minus/ 10.3 deg E of true N at a depth of 11,500 ft, increasing with depth at a rate of 1 deg per 50 ft. This method of measuring the orientation of horizontal principal axes is considerably more accurate than previous methods tried at Fenton Hill. The results agree generally with other stress indicators. The results support the concept that direction of reservoir growth during hydraulic stimulation favours the intermediate axis over other principal axes of stress. 11 figs., 1 tab.
Water Loss from the Phase II Reservoir Region\1988\Since this topic has become so pressing due to the June deadline for obtaining water rights, and planning for water purchases, I felt a brief note on the topic would be appropriate. (Even though the analysis of the Expt. 2074 data is not completed.) First, and foremost, it should be obvious that reservoir water loss is a function of reservoir pressure, not reservoir injection flow rate. Therefore, for predicative purposes, the water loss should be considered to be a specific flow rate for some given time at a given reservoir pressure level. Second, the L TFT will be operated at a pressure level which precludes active reservoir growth; i.e. an essentially aseismic reservoir flow test. From the ICFT results, reservoir operation at or below an injection pressure of about 4200 psi appears to have temperately inhibited reservoir growth. However, since the last half of the ICFT was conducted at EE-3A injection pressures generally above 4500 psi and with active seismicity, the near-constant 78 gpm water loss during the last 6 days of this 30-day flow test should be considered excessive for LTFT predictions. This is particularly true when one also considers the EE-2 parasitic water loss up and behind the casing and into the old Phase I reservoir region, which was not accounted for in the 78 gpm water loss given above. (This bypass flow path has since been cemented off) 
Completion of the Modeling of the ICFT with FEHM\1989\The computer code Finite Element Heat and Mass Transfer (FEHM) has been developed at the Laboratory to simulate geothermal reservoirs (Zyvoloski et al., 1988) The code solves the three-dimensional conservation of mass and energy equations subject to the assumption that Darcy's law applies. In addition, tracer tests can be modeled through solution of the solute transport equation. In this report, code modifications that allow simulation of the reservoir porosity and permeability dependence on temperature and pressure are presented. Also, results of the application of the modified code to the ICFT data are presented. Birdsell and Robinson (1988) used FEHM to develop a three dimensional, equivalent-porous-medium model of fluid, heat, and tracer transport during the ICFT. They showed calculations that suggest that, unlike the Phase I reservoir, the Phase II system can be modeled as an equivalent porous medium. The modeling approach incorporated as much of the transient hydraulic, temperature, tracer, and logging data as possible into a single model to increase the confidence in the model. Although the model provided a better understanding of HOR reservoirs, one conclusion of the study was that a more detailed model, one that includes earth-stress effects, is required in order to match the data. This was most noticeable in the tracer data and the reservoir impedance. The heat and mass transfer solution in FEHM could not account for the large differences in tracer responses in tests that were conducted only two weeks apart. Comparison of the tracer responses showed that the fluid volume of the reservoir had grown by almost 300% (Robinson et al., 1987). Growth of this magnitude can be ascribed to fluid storage caused be a widening of fracture apertures. The reservoir impedance increased with time in the FEHM model while the ICFT data showed a steady decrease in impedance. The increase in impedance predicted by FEHM was due solely to the increase in viscosity with decreasing temperature. The viscosity increases between the hot and cold portions of the Phase II reservoir by an order of magnitude. However, in a model that accounts for the permeability change due to the widening of fracture apertures, for example the cubic law, the effect of increasing permeability can far outweigh the effect of increasing viscosity on the reservoir impedance. 
Considerations for the LTFT in FY92\1989\The following reviews the schedule and budget for running the Long Term Flow Test (LTFT) in FY92. The LTFT. The principal objective of the LTFT is to provide an estimate of the long term heat extraction capability anti overal1 engineering performance of the Phase A reservoir as now accessed by wellbores EE-2A and EE-3A. Estimates of heat extraction capability will consist of at least two parts. production temperature decline and reactive tracer measurements, each having an associated uncertainty in terms of the outcome of the LTFT. First, the temperature decline of produced fluids will be used to calibrate heat extraction co<les that will then he used to simulate the long term perfom1ance of the reservoir. The uncertainty associated with this approach is the possibility that production temperatures will not decline during the test. hut may remain constant or even gradually increase. Taken at face value. such an event may appear to be highly desirable. In fact. the volumetrically fractured model of the reservoir predicts constant temperatures for an extended period of time followed by a rapidly declining temperature. If the production temperature does not decline. then an extension of the LTFT into a second year of operations. as suggested on a couple of occasions by DOE. would make good sense technically . Secondly, measurement of the decomposition of reactive tracers in the reservoir is expected to provide information on the advance of cooled rock volume as �it expands from the injection well to the prod11ction well. Although the preparatory laboratory studies are well under way, the attempt to make this type of measurement in the field is without precedent and. consequently. it is a true experiment. subject to an unexpected outcome. and could result in increased emphasis on the temperature decline discussed above. 
Experiment 2077: First Pressurization Phase\1989\The first phase of Expl. 2077 was completed on Thursday, 27 April. after 30 days of continuous operation at Fenton Hill. During this time, a total of 492.000 gallons of water was injected into the Phase 11 reservoir through the EE-3A wellbore using a combination of the two Kobe pumps (9 gpm and l 9 gpm). From an analysis of the available data. it is apparent that the majority of this water went into reinflating the reservoir, rather than to permeation to the far field. 
Hot Dry Rock geothermal energy--- A new energy agenda for the twenty-first century\1989\Hot Dry Rock (HDR) geothermal energy, which utilizes the natural heat contained in the earth's crust, can provide a widely available source of nonpolluting energy. It can help mitigate the continued warming of the earth through the ''greenhouse effect,'' and the accelerating destruction of forests and crops by acid rain, two of the major environmental consequences of our ever-increasing use of fossil fuels for heating and power generation. In addition, HDR, as a readily available source of indigenous energy, can reduce our nation's dependence on imported oil, enhancing national security and reducing our trade deficit. The earth's heat represents an almost unlimited source of energy that can begin to be exploited within the next decade through the HDR heat-mining concept being actively developed in the United States and in several other countries. On a national scale, we can begin to develop this new energy source, using it directly for geothermal power or indirectly in hybrid geothermal/fossil-fueled systems, in diverse applications such as: baseload power generation, direct heat use, feedwater heating in conventional power plants, and pumped storage/load leveling power generation. This report describes the nature of the HDR resource and the technology required to implement the heat-mining concept in several applications. An assessment of the requirements for establishing HDR feasibility is presented in the context of providing a commercially competitive energy source. 37 refs., 6 figs.
Hot Dry Rock Geothermal Energy Development Program Annual Report Fiscal Year 1987\1989\During Fiscal Year 1987, emphasis in the Hot Dry Rock Geothermal Energy Development Program was on preparations for a Long-Term Flow Test'' of the Phase II'' or Engineering'' hot dry rock energy system at Fenton Hill, New Mexico. A successful 30-day flow test of the system during FY86 indicated that such a system would produce heat at a temperature and rate that could support operation of a commercial electrical power plant. However, it did not answer certain questions basic to the economics of long-term operation, including the rate of depletion of the thermal reservoir, the rate of water loss from the system, and the possibility of operating problems during extended continuous operation. Preparations for a one-year flow test of the system to answer these and more fundamental questions concerning hot dry rock systems were made in FY87: design of the required surface facilities; procurement and installation of some of their components; development and testing of slimline logging tools for use through small-diameter production tubing; research on temperature-sensitive reactive chemical tracers to monitor thermal depletion of the reservoir; and computer simulations of the 30-day test, extended to modeling the planned Long-Term Flow Test. 45 refs., 34 figs., 5 tabs.
ICFT: An initial closed-loop flow test of the Fenton Hill Phase II HDR reservoir\1989\A 30-day closed-loop circulation test of the Phase II Hot Dry Rock reservoir at Fenton Hill, New Mexico, was conducted to determine the thermal, hydraulic, chemical, and seismic characteristics of the reservoir in preparation for a long-term energy-extraction test. The Phase II heat-extraction loop was successfully tested with the injection of 37,000 m/sup 3/ of cold water and production of 23,300 m/sup 3/ of hot water. Up to 10 MW/sub t/ was extracted when the production flow rate reached 0.0139 m/sup 3//s at 192/degree/C. By the end of the test, the water-loss rate had decreased to 26% and a significant portion of the injected water was recovered; 66% during the test and an additional 20% during subsequent venting. Analysis of thermal, hydraulic, geochemical, tracer, and seismic data suggests the fractured volume of the reservoir was growing throughout the test. 19 refs., 64 figs., 19 tabs.
Kinetics of aryl halide hydrolysis using isothermal and temperature-programmed reaction analyses\1989\Kinetics for the alkaline hydrolysis of aryl halides in an acetate-carbonate buffer are determined. These quantitative results corroborate qualitative relative reactivities form the literature for aryl halides with different substituent groups, location of substituent group, and species of halogen. Both temperature-programmed reaction with a nonlinear temperature-rise rate and isothermal reaction analyses were used. The TPY technique provides results that are similar to isothermal reaction analysis in accuracy and ability to discriminate the most appropriate kinetic rate law, but the results are obtained in a much shorter experimental time.
LTFT Operating Parameters\1989\In order to finalize planning. the following specifications are recommended for the operation of the LTFT. Although operation of the reservoir under the specified conditions provides for a comprehensive evaluation of the Phase 11 reservoir. these conditions differ significantly from those that were anticipated prior to the I CFT in I 986. Prior to that time (and with much greater anticipated program budgets than we have subsequently obtained). the goal of the LTFf was sustained reservoir power production approaching 20 MW(t) with production temperatures higher than 200�C. Based on our current knowledge of the production characteristics of the reservoir, we predict the initial production to be below 10 MW(t), and thereafter to increase slowly to about 16 MW(t) under optimistic projections. However. production temperatures in excess 200�C will he achieved. The principal reason fur projecting low power production is that the reservoir flow impedance measured in transient testing is of the order of 50 psi/gpm , a factor of 3 greater than the nominal impedance of the Phase I system ( 15 psi/gpm). A flow impedance of 10 psi/gpm is needed to meet the pre-ICFT goals for the LTFT. We believe that we understand the reasons for the high impedance and will take steps to reduce it prior to beginning the L TFT. However. it is only conjecture that the now impedance can be reduced significantly lo affect the outcome of the LTFT as currently envisaged. 
Repair, sidetrack, drilling, and completion of EE-2A for Phase 2 reservoir production service\1989\Hot Dry Rock (HDR) geothermal energy well EE-2 at Fenton Hill, New Mexico, was sidetracked and redrilled into the HDR Phase II reservoir after two unsuccessful attempts to repair damage in the lower wellbore. Before sidetracking was begun, six cement slurries were pumped to plug the abandoned lower wellbore and to support the production casing where drilling wear was predicted and where sidetracking was to occur. This work and the redrill of EE-2A were completed in November 1987. Specifications were prepared for a state-of-the-art tie-back casing, which was procured, manufactured, and delivered to Fenton Hill in May 1988. The well was then completed in June 1988 for hot-water production service by cementing in a liner and the upper section of production casing and installing and cementing a tie-back casing string. 24 refs., 17 figs., 5 tabs.
Results of investigation at the Miravalles Geothermal Field, Costa Rica: Part 1, Well logging.\1989\The well-logging operations performed in the Miravalles Geothermal Field in Costa Rica were conducted during two separate field trips. The Phase I program provided the deployment of a suite of high-temperature borehole instruments, including the temperature/rabbit, fluid sampler, and three-arm caliper in Well PGM-3. These same tools were deployed in Well PGM-10 along with an additional survey run with a combination fluid velocity/temperature/pressure instrument used to measure thermodynamic properties under flowing well conditions. The Phase II program complemented Phase I with the suite of tools deployed in Wells PGM-5, PGM-11, and PGM-12. 4 refs., 25 figs., 1 tab.
Statement of Michael E. Berger Director Energy and Technology Initiatives Office Los Alamos National Laboratory to United States House of Representatives Committee on Science, Space, and Technology Subcommittee on Energy Research and Development Concerning Geothermal Energy Programs March 2, 1989\1989\The funding profile needed to complete the Fenton Hill program is $5.6 million in FY90, followed by $4.4 million in FY 1991 and $3.6 million in FY 1992. The current DOE funding profile of $3.6 million per year for several years does not provide enough money in FY90 to purchase the expensive pumping and surface equipment and the operating personnel in FY 1991 required to conduct the Long-Term Flow Test, the last major milestone of the Fenton Hill program. Instead, the test must be deferred for at least one year, which delays program completion and increases total costs. In addition, there is some technical danger with this delay. The reservoir fractures were created in hot, highly stressed rock. Reservoir testing results in water being forced through the fracture at high pressure, which keeps the fractures open. A delay of one or more years could result in closure and healing of these fractures, so that an additional cost, nearly $0.8 million, of refracturing may have to be incurred. Following completion of the long-term flow test, a small research program will be necessary to support industry in their use of the technology. This advanced R&D program would require approximately $2.5 mill ion per year for several years and would focus on further reductions of HOR costs and risks to facilitate the next step of development which is commercialization by private industry. 
Stress control of seismicity patterns observed during hydraulic fracturing experiments at the Fenton Hill hot dry rock geothermal energy site, New Mexico\1989\Seismicity accompanying hydraulic injections into granitic rock is often diffuse rather than falling along a single plane. A new scheme for determining orientations and locations of planes along which the microearthquakes occurred was recently developed. The method has been applied to four hydraulic fracturing experiments conducted at Fenton Hill as part of a hot dry rock geothermal energy project. The ratio of shear to normal stress along planes of all orientations is calculated using a best estimate of the current stress state at Fenton Hill.--Modified journal abstract.
Subsurface Geology of the Fenton Hill Hot Dry Rock Geothermal Energy Site\1989\The Precambrian rock penetrated by wells EE-2A and -3A belongs to one or more granitic to granodioritic plutons. The plutonic rock contains two major xenolith zones of amphibolite, locally surrounded by fine-grained mafic rock of hybrid igneous origin. The granodiorite is cut by numerous leucogranite dikes that diminish in abundance with depth. The most prominent structural feature is the main breccia zone, in which the rock is highly fractured and moderately altered. This zone is at least 75 m thick and is of uncertain but near-horizontal orientation. Fracture abundance decreases with increasing depth below the main breccia zone, and fractures tend to be associated with leucogranite dikes. This association suggests that at least some of the fractures making up the geothermal reservoir are of Precambrian age or have long-range orientations controlled by the presence of Precambrian-age granitic dikes.
Hot dry rock reservoir engineering\1990\The broad subject of reservoir engineering covers many aspects of the development of hot dry rock (HDR) geothermal energy systems. Beginning with the drilling of the initial wellbore, and extending through the long-term flow testing of the completed system, reservoir engineering is involved in almost every step of tbt development. In fact, the Los Alamos HDR team views the understanding of the mechanical, thermal, and hydraulic behavior of HDR reservoirs -- and the most appropriate methods for interrogating them to gain this understanding -- as our most significant technical contribution to be ultimately transferred to industry. Obviously, however, HDR reservoirs will differ in their geometry, properties, and internal structure from site to site. Therefore, the most appropriate method(s) for exploiting the HDR resource in various geological and structural settings will be based on a detailed understanding of each type of reservoir encountered. How one gains this understanding and uses it to create an HDR system is the essence of the subject of reservoir engineering. 
Hot dry rock; a realistic energy option\1990\In 1970. the concept of utilizing HDR as a practical energy source was little more than science fiction. Today, after more than more than 15 years of intensive field work at Fenton Hill, the viability of this concept has been demonstrated in experimental systems. Worldwide interest in the development of this resource has led to active programs a number of countries. The goal for the future is to overcome existing impediments so that this abundant. widespread. and environmentally sound technology can be brought to the market by industry at an economically competitive price. 
Kinetics of alkaline hydrolysis of organic esters and amides in neutrally-buffered solution\1990\Reaction rate constants for the hydrolysis of organic esters and amides were determined at temperatures of 100-240C in aqueous solutions buffered at pH values between 5.5 and 7.3. Experiments are modeled assuming alkaline hydrolysis with a thermodynamic solution model included to account for the temperature dependence of hydroxide ion concentration. In most cases, the ester hydrolysis second order rate constants agree well with published values from experiments in strongly basic solutions at pH values from 11 to 14 and temperatures from 25-80 despite the large extrapolations required to compare the data sets. The amide hydrolysis rate constants are about one order of magnitude higher than the extrapolated results from other investigators, but the reaction rate increased proportionally with hydroxide ion concentration, suggesting that an alkaline hydrolysis mechanism is also appropriate. These data establish the validity of the alkaline hydrolysis mechanism and can be used to predict hydrolysis reaction rates in neutrally-buffered solutions such as many groundwater and geothermal fluids.
Modeling the hydraulic characteristics of the Fenton Hill, New Mexico hot dry rock reservoir\1990\A conceptual model is developed for fluid flow in the Fenton Hill, New Mexico Hot Dry Rock (HDR) geothermal reservoir. The model consists of discrete fractures whose apertures, and hence permeabilities, arc strong functions of pressure. Fluid storage occurs within the main fracture system and in the surrounding country rock. Using a fracture network simulator, the reservoir model has been calibrated using reservoir test data obtained at a variety of pressures and flow rates with the system undergoing either circulation or injection with no production. Model results indicate that operating the reservoir with the production well at a higher pressure than is usually used could improve the performance by reducing the pressure difference between the injection and production wells required for circulation. An experiment is designed using numerical simulations to address the following issues: I) the operating conditions we should employ for the test, 2) the test duration, and 3) the Possibility of inducing unwanted reservoir extension. This test is scheduled to be carried out in the late summer of this year. 
Modeling to Support the Design of the High Backpressure Experiment\1990\The proposed high backpressure experiment, Experiment 2078, is simulated using the fracture network model. The model parameters have been calibrated using data from both the water loss experiment (Experiment 2077) and the ICFT data. The issues addressed in this study are: 1) the operating conditions we should employ for the test, 2) the test duration, and 3) the need for and schedule of microseismic monitoring to detect reservoir extension. It is proposed that the test attempt to determine two reservoir parameters: 1) the performance of the reservoir at high backpressure (impedance), and 2) the pressure at which fracture extension at the reservoir boundaries occurs. Under the base case conditions proposed for the test (injection at 2 bpm at a backpressure of 2000 psi), a 12-day circulation test should provide one good data point on reservoir performance at high backpressure. However, attempting to measure flow characteristics at two backpressures in a 12-day test would probably compromise the quality of the data, due to the length of time required to reach steady state. Extension of the reservoir is possible given the pressures we are likely to reach at the boundaries of the reservoir, but extension and seismicity is unlikely during the high back:pressure portion of the test. Thus, limited microseismic coverage (without EE-1) is recommended during the high back:pressure operation unless seismicity occurs. In the event that we detect no microseismicity during the circulation test, it is advisable that the test be continued with ho production and constant injection using the big Kobe pump. In this portion of the test we would increase the reservoir pressure until microseismicity occurs. This important reservoir information, obtained with minimal additional manpower expenditure, will be used to design the L 1FT and also to carry out reservoir performance calculations under different operating modes. 
Progress in hot dry rock technology development\1990\The hot dry rock (HDR) geothermal energy program at Los Alamos is directed toward demonstrating the viability of HDR as a practical energy source. Recently, reservoir characterization experiments have been carried out to evaluate water loss and reservoir inflation under pressurized conditions over a long time period. In addition, advances have been made in reservoir engineering, seismic modeling, and tracer development. Preparations are being made to conduct a long term flow test (LTTT) to evaluate the thermal power potential of the existing Phase II reservoir at Fenton Hill, New Mexico. The reservoir is located 12,000 ft below the surface and has an estimated capacity of about a million gallons. The LTFT Is scheduled to start in 1991 and will run for 1-2 years. This paper summarizes recent developments in all of the above areas. 
Proposed Schedule for Fenton Hill Experiments\1990\To help in planning Fenton Hill experimental operations in concert with preparations for the Long-Term Flow Test (LTFT) next summer, the following schedule is proposed. This schedule fits some of the realities of the next few months, including the Laboratory closure during the Holidays, the seismic monitoring tests in Roswell, and the difficulties of operating during the winter months. Whenever possible, cyclic pumping operations during the colder months will be scheduled so that the pump will be on during the late evening and early morning hours to prevent freezeup. 
Estimates of Rock Volume Suitable for Heat Transfer Calculations\1991\The purpose of this memo is to document our current best estimates of reservoir rock volume on the basis of microseismic, tracer, and hydraulic data. It is understood that this estimate is to be used in a heat transfer calculation, and thus must represent the effective volume from which heat will be extracted. The size estimates will attempt to account for the fact that not all rock stimulated during a hydraulic fracturing experiment is necessarily part of the swept volume when a steady state flow field is established between the wells. 
Experiment 2077\1991\"On Thursday afternoon (8/22) at 1711 h, reservoir pressure maintenance at 17 MPa was terminated due to a high-pressure leak at a welded joint In the stainless-steel tubing within the ""Hydro"" trailer. Therefore, the fluid storage partitioning experiment at 17 MPa has been scrubbed. Since that time, the reservoir pressure has been slowly decaying. At 0800h this morning (8/26), the reservoir pressure had already dropped to 15.8 MPa (2290 ps1). The decision has been made not to repair the high-pressure piping In the Hydro trailer, so the 19-gpm Kobe pump is no longer available for reservoir pressurization. Therefore, the reservoir will remain shut-in and venting through the annulus at EE-3A until about the 9th of September, at which time the I-R pumps may be available to re-pressurize the reservoir back to 17� MPa. The reservoir pressure will then be maintained at about 17 MPa (2470 psi) by intermittent pumping using one or the other of the 1-R pumps, This mode of pressure maintenance will be conducted until late October, when reservoir flow testing will commence. The annulus bypass flow rate at EE-3A has increased somewhat during the past week, from 2.27 gpm to 2.36 gpm. With a peripheral water loss rate of 5,0 gpm at 17 MPa, It will require about 75,000 gallons of water per week to maintain a reservoir pressure level of 17 MPa This volume could be satisfied by 15 hours of pumping per week with one 1-R pump at a rate of 2 bpm (84 gpm), or 12 hours at a rate of about 2- I /2 bpm < 102 gpm). "
Experiment 2078: The Initial Phase of the LTFT – Preliminary Flow Testing of the Phase II Reservoir and a Complete Checkout of the New Surface Plant and the Integrated Digital Control and Data Acquisition Systems\1991\Experiment 2078 is planned as the initial phase of the Long-Term Flow Test. As such, it represents the shakedown cruise for the entire flowing system in its present configuration -- both the reservoir and the integrated surface plant. Since the Phase 11 reservoir has been continuously pressurized for the past 2-1 /2 years at a mean pressure of about 15 MP a (2180 psi), it is essential to reestablish the relationships between surface injection and production pressures, and the resulting production flow rates These relationships are needed before proceeding to the first -- seismic -- phase of steady-state reservoir operation now planned to start early next year. 
Logging Report 1 – Temperature/Gamma Ray/Collar Locator Log, EE-2A, 2450 psig Shut-in Log, August 8, 1991\1991\"Oil Well Perforators (OWP) was mobilized on August 5th and arrived on August 6th. OWP's grease injection head was installed on the LANL wireline and the wireline was re-headed with a LANL cable head. OWP provided the following- pressure control equipment: a 40 ft long 5-1/2"" API 5000 psig WP (working pressure) casing lubricator, a 5-1/2"" API 3000 psig WP wireline blow-out-preventer, a 15000 psig WP grease injection head with 0.425-0.430 11 flow tubes and a grease injection system, and the 15000 psig WP high pressure hoses needed to connect the grease system to the grease head. The grease head included three flow sections, two active and one reserve, and two injection hoses were run to the head. A hydraulic pack-off on top of the grease head is activated through a small hose and hand hydraulic pump when the wireline is stationary. The grease injection pump had automatic pressure control and was permanently mounted in the back of the winterized pressure control van with a charging pump, grease barrels, suction and discharge piping and grease storage area. EE-2A wellhead was prepared for logging by opening the lower master valve, checking the upper master valve to be sure it was open, and closing the logging valve above the flow cross. The lower master valve was not sealing and it was not necessary to equalize it before it was opened. our blind flange on top of the logging valve was removed and OWP installed their adapter flange. "
Monthly HDR Technical Status Report for August 1991\1991\It is informative to summarize the injection and venting results for Experiment 2077 for the entire year 1990 -- information that is required for our annual report to the New Mexico State Engineer's Office. A total of 3, 174,000 (12,020 m3) gallons were injected into the Phase 11 reservoir, while 1,298,000 (4912 m3) were vented from the reservoir via the EE-3A annulus leak path from the high-pressure reservoir. Thus, the total permeation loss to the far field during 1990 was about 1,877,000 gallons (7,104 m3), at a mean rate of 3.57 gpm C0.225 kg/s). The mean reservoir pressure during the year was 2223 psi ( 15.32 MPa) above hydrostatic. Even though this apparent reservoir water loss rate of 0.225 kg/s appears to be very small, over a years time, the total loss to the far field at a reservoir pressure approaching that anticipated during the L TFT was almost 2 million gallons.
Proposed Objectives and Tentative Schedule for Surface Circulation and Injection Testing of the Phase II Reservoir Test Facility – Nov. 20 to 25, 1991\1991\"The following are proposed for the initial Test Facility commissioning and training operations. 1. Set up and test alarm modes on FIXDMACS program with a alarm print out to the guard shack. (automatic shut down is not installed). 2. Set up and test the control loop for fluid level control in the PRODUCTION SEPARATOR using the feed pumps for circulation and using the 125 psig air system for a vapor supply. 3. Test the main injection pump HPl during high pressure injection (1 hour test) for proper valve action and leak check the valves. 4. Test the performance of the main injection pump HP2 during surface loop circulation and injection into EE-3A. Watch for the following: a. The operating life of the 100 mesh ""start-up"" strainers and substitute a 60 mesh strainer if the service life is less than 8 hours on the second run. b. The life of the re-faced pump valves with start-up strainers in service. Watch the pump volumetric efficiency and inspect the valves if there is any evidence of a decrease. Recurrences of the pounding noise on the pump discharge. "
Reservoir Inflation Schedule\1991\Inflation of the reservoir is to begin on Friday afternoon, November 22 and continue through mid day on Monday, November 25. Inflation of the reservoir shall be accomplished by using only injection pump, HP-2. NOTE: Under no circumstances should injection pump, HP-1 be operated. 
Water Loss Considerations of the LTFT\1991\"Since the LTFT is now being considered as a 2-year test with about 1 -1 /2 years of ""steadystate"" reservoir production -- i.e., at constant conditions of reservoir inlet and outlet pressure (but not necessarily flow rate or production temperature), it is necessary to investigate the limitations on this steady-state period of production as imposed by our available supply of makeup water. For CY 1992, we have 30 acre-feet of water permitted, but not yet purchased. If we start next year with the 5-milJion gallon pond full, and accept that the one plus years of steady-state operation will undoubtedly bracket CY 1992 if the LTFT starts in the fall of 1991 , this available makeup water supply equates to a maximum makeup flow rate of 28 gpm. As outlined in the referenced memorandum, most of the LTFT will be operated at an injection pressure -- nominally 3900 psi -- that will induce some reservoir extension in the nonproducing portion of the reservoir deep and to the south of EE-3A. Therefore, the majority of the LTFT will be accompanied by a modest level of microseismic activity concentrated in the highest-boundary-pressure region farthest from the pressure sink represented by the production wellbore EE-2A. The first 15-day segment of the ICFT in 1986, operated at an injection rate of about 4 bpm, appears to represent a very reasonable analog to our anticipated LTFT extended steady-state operational phase. At the end of this first segment of the ICFT, the following conditions obtained: "
Experiment 2078B: Reservoir Inflation & Brief Pump to Seismicity\1992\As presently planned, the Phase ll reservoir will be reinflated beginning next Monday morning, January 27th (Refer to Memorandum EES-4-92-15 from Ray Ponden dated January 17, 1992). This reinflation will last about 3-1 /2 days. By Monday morning. January 27th. the reservoir pressure should stand at about 1620 psi. ll is proposed that the initial pressurization be at the maximum available pumping rate which does not exceed the injection pressure limit of 4500 psi. However, after reaching a reservoir pressure of 3100 psi, the pumping rate should he reduced to about 80 gpm so that the rate of pressure rise is considerably reduced. This threshold pressure of 3100 psi is here specified because late last year, the reservoir was inflated twice to a maximum pressure of about 3100 psi without any apparent seismicity. Pump shut-downs for testing or maintenance should actually help this experiment, particularly above reservoir pressures of 3 JOO psi, by providing al least some time for pressure equilibration within the reservoir. During this I /2 days of reinflation. the reservoir pressure is expected to exceed 3100 psi -- a level which has previously been determined to be aseismic. However, we can only speculate as to the pressure level at which the reservoir will again start to grow by fracture extension at its periphery - as evidenced by renewed seismic activity. Therefore, during this brief test. a three-ax.is geophone package will be deployed at a depth of 9400 feet in wellbore EE-J to better determine the onset of microseismicity at the boundaries of the present Phase 1I reservoir. 
Experiment 2078C: Second Preliminary Reservoir Flow Test\1992\Experiment 2078C is planned as a second brief circulation test of the Phase lI reservoir and a fu1iher checkout of the L TFT surface test facility. From a reservoir standpoint, the primary objective of this second flow test is to again evaluate the reservoir flow performance under conditions of high backpressure (the same as maintained during Experiment 2078A -- 2210 psi), but at a higher injection flow rate and pressure -- in the range of 150 gpm at 4200 psi. This experiment is planned to begin Monday morning, 2/3/92, and to continue through Saturday evening, 2/8/92. Again, this experiment will be conducted in three distinct phases as follows: The Phase II reservoir has recently been reinflated to a pressure of about 3190 psi during Experimen1 20788. This reinflation began Monday afternoon ( l /27 /92) and continued through Thursday ( l /30/92) at 15:00. Following pump shutdown Thursday afternoon, it is expected that the reservoir pressure will decay to about 2600 psi by noon Monday 
FEHMN 1.0: Finite element heat and mass transfer code; Revision 1\1992\A computer code is described which can simulate non-isothermal multi-phase multicomponent flow in porous media. It is applicable to natural-state studies of geothermal systems and groundwater flow. The equations of heat and mass transfer for multiphase flow in porous and permeable media are solved sing the finite element method. The permeability and porosity of the medium are allowed to depend on pressure and temperature. The code also has provisions for movable air and water phases and noncoupled tracers; that is, tracer solutions that do not affect the heat and mass transfer solutions. The tracers can be passive or reactive. The code can simulate two-dimensional, two-dimensional radial, or three-dimensional geometries. A summary of the equations in the model and the numerical solution procedure are provided in this report. A user`s guide and sample problems are also included. The FEHMN (Finite Element Heat and Mass Nuclear) code, described in this report, is a version of FEHM (Finite Element Heat and Mass, Zyvoloski et al., 1988) developed for the Yucca Mountain Site Characterization Project (YMP). The main use of FEHMN will be to assist in the understanding of flow fields in the saturated zone below the potential Yucca Mountain repository.
Fenton Hill Operations\1992\Attached is a copy of the schedule for Fenton Hill operations over the next 5 months. The efforts during this period will be directed toward conducting a 90 day flow test at aseismic operating conditions. This test will be preceded by two others. The first will be an operations test. This is a continuation of the start-up testing that was begun in early December to verify the performance of the surface plant. The second will be a baseline test that will be performed to establish the optimum operating conditions for the 90 day test. 
HDR Commercialization Plan\1992\A vast store of energy can be found almost everywhere at reachable depths within the earth in the form of HOR. The goal of the plan outlined here is to bring the commercialization of the technology to full fruition within a period of seven years. Accomplishment of this goal can lead to abundant, cheap energy for the nation, a clean environment, additional domestic jobs in energy development and production, and world leadership in energy together with the attendant export opportunities. The goal is ambitious but achievable- and the prize is worth going after. 
Initial Conditions for Experiment 2078D\1992\During Expt. 2078B which was conducted last week (1/27 - 1/30), the Phase II reservoir was reinflated to a pressure of about 22.0 MPa (3190 psi) in 3 days. A primary objective of this experiment was to test for the onset of reservoir growth as the reservoir pressure was increased above 3125 psi, the previous peak reservoir pressure which was achieved during the first pre-inflation phase of Expt 2078A in late November. It was anticipated that this renewed reservoir growth would be evidenced by both the initiation of seismic activity at the reservoir periphery and by a sharp increase in the rate of water loss. (It should be noted, however, that during last weeks reinflation, the injection rate was about 146 gpm, somewhat greater than the 111 gpm rate used last November; a situation that might affect the onset of seismicity .) Wednesday morning, when the reservoir pressure has reached about 3080 psi, the reservoir apparently became seismically active for the first time in over 4 years. At the same time, as shown in Figure 1, there was both a marked drop in the reservoir pressure and a change in the slope of the pressure rise with no change in injection conditions. Subsequent to this sharp drop in reservoir pressure, there was a marked increase in the rate of reservoir water loss -- to about 45 gpm. This rate of water loss is quite close to the measured 53 gpm water loss rate that followed the onset of renewed microseismic activity 1 O days into the ICFT in mid-1986. 
Operational Readiness Review for the Hot Dry Rock Long-Term Flow Test (LTFT) at the Fenton Hill Facility\1992\This ORR is a LANL internal review, conducted at the request of the EES Division Leader. The L TFT experiment is to be conducted by members of Group EES-4, and contractor personnel. Approval of this ORR rests with the EES Division Office. The scope of the ORR covers the following areas as they relate to the readiness of the LTFT experimental program to safely proceed to full operation. Environmental, Safety, and Health (ES&H) issues are considered in the evaluation of the three areas below. These considerations will include, at a minimum, an evaluation that the L TFT will operate within the bounds defined by the State and Federal Regulations and LANL policies. 
Pre-test estimates of temperature decline for the LANL Fenton Hill Long-Term Flow Test\1992\Pre-test predications for the Long-Term Flow Test (LTFT) of the experimental Hot Dry Rock (HDR) reservoir at Fenton Hill were made using two models. Both models are dependent on estimates of the ``effective`` reservoir volume accessed by the fluid and the mean fracture spacing (MFS) of major joints for fluid flow. The effective reservoir volume was estimated using a variety of techniques, and the range of values for the MFS was set through experience in modeling the thermal cooldown of other experimental HDR reservoirs. The two pre-test predictions for cooldown to 210{degrees}C (a value taken to compare the models) from initial temperature of 240{degrees}C are 6.1 and 10.7 years. Assuming that a minimum of 10{degrees}C is required to provide an unequivocal indication of thermal cooldown, both models predict that the reservoir will not exhibit observable cooldown for at least two years.
Results from Experiment 2078A: Initial 3-Day Flow Test\1992\Experiment 2078A was conducted from Dec. 2 through Dec. 8, 1991. The primary objective of the series of operations, here referred to as Expt. 2078A, was the start-up testing of the entire surface plant using produced fluid from the reservoir for the first time. As part of this experiment, the reservoir was flow tested for three days from Dec. 4 through Dec. 7 -- the first circulation test of the Phase II reservoir in almost 4 years. Experiment 2078A was the first in a sequence of preliminary reservoir pressurization and/or flow tests scheduled prior to beginning the 90-day Long-Term Flow Test (L TFT) in early March, 1992. Experiment 2078A was conducted in three distinct phases as follows: 1. A 2-day reservoir inflation phase lasting from the afternoon of Dec. 2 through noon on Dec. 4, 2. A 3-day production flow test lasting through the evening of Dec. 7, and 3. A final low-flow-rate reservoir vent test (with no injection) to investigate the thermal performance of the surface loop and the aircooled heat exchanger in a simulated winter shut-down mode. The emphasis of this report is on the reservoir flow performance during the 3-day production test, with the results from the final vent test being covered elsewhere. 
Results of the Tracer Experiment on May 19, 1992\1992\A tracer experiment was performed starting on May 18, 1992 to test the flow characteristics of the Phase 2 reservoir. Three tracers were injected: sodium fluorescein, p-toluenesulphonic acid (p-TSA), and p-bromo-nitrobenzene (p-BNB). The fluorescein breakthrough curve was similar to that in the first dye tracer experiment on March 12, indicating that apparently most of the tracer was injected into EE-2 despite the fact that in the March 12 experiment we thought we had spilled a significant fraction of the tracer. The p-TSA tracer was determined to be conservative (non-reactive), and in fact a comparison of it and the fluorescein showed that it is more conservative than fluorescein. The dye is probably undergoing a slight thermal degradation reaction. These two tracers will be used in tandem in future tests to see if the fluorescein results can be interpreted as a thermally sensitive tracer. The tracer results are now analyzed using a revised version of the data processing software that accounts for the effect of recirculation of tracer. Quantitative analysis of the p-TSA breakthrough curve shows that, for example, only 40% of the fluid travels between the wells with residence time less than 1.5 days. This means that there are numerous long-residence time flow paths, an attribute that suggests good heat extraction characteristics. The p-bromo-nitrobenzene reactive tracer experiment has not yielded an interpretable result to date - neither the reactant or product has been detected in the production fluid. We are attempting to discover why this is so, and to adjust the experimental procedure to overcome these difficulties in the future. 
Results of the Winter Flow Experiments Conducted on December 7-8, February 7-8, and February 28-29, 1992\1992\A winter flow regime has been proposed as a method of maintaining a non-freezing environment following the loss of circulation in the HOR Reservoir test facility when ambient temperature is below 32�F. The regime, as presently envisioned, would automatically convert the surface facility from reservoir circulation to low rate reservoir production through the entire operating system except the EE-3A wellhead, the EE-2A x-mas tree, and the make-up/feed pump/water supply system. Once a shut-down of the surface facility is detected or initiated by the DMACS control system the following actions are initiated by the DMACS HH/LL alarm sequence. 
Summary of LTFT Reservoir Operating Conditions Since May 5th\1992\The attached reservoir data are listed in tabular form showing both dates and the number of days since May 5th so the tabular data can be referenced to the plots which follow. The plots show only the steady reservoir operation with a 1400 psi production wellhead pressure. That is, the data resulting from system shut-ins and backpressures other than 1400 psi are not shown in the plots. The plots illustrate significant reservoir changes over the past 80 days. The production flow rate has declined 10.3% from 100.7 gpm to a current value of 90.3 gpm. Since the impedance is derived from production flow, the reservoir impedance plot shows a corresponding increase from 24 psi/gpm to 28.3 psi/gpm. As the production flow has decreased, the production temperature has also declined from around 184.7 �c to 182.7 �C. Finally, the reservoir water loss data fails to reveal any distinct trend so far, but the mean water loss over the past 80 days is calculated at 10.9% of the injected. 
EE-2A Logging Report\1993\Two logs of EE-3A were performed during the last couple of weeks. The first of which, was a Temperature/Casing-Collar Locator(CCL) log, which took place on Friday, December 10th., 1993. The second log was a Caliper log which was done in cooperation with the Dia-Log Company, of Odessa, TX. an Monday, December, 13th., 1993. This log was run, using a slimline tool, with the largest diameter being that of the cable head (2. 125'') . . The tool was 35 1/2 ft. long and weighed approximately 276 lbs. Special sinker subs were built for this tool to give it adequate weight to go in against wellhead pressure, which was 920 psi, at the time of the log . 
Hot Dry Rock (Transition to an Industry-Based Technology)\1993\Hot Dry Rock potentially can supply a vast new class of geothermal resources within the technical and economic grasp of the U.S. geothermal industry. The US HDR resource base is over 10 million quads. The US has sponsored research on this technology for over 20 years, with an investment totaling over 150 million. Results have been highly promising, to the extent that several other nations (i.e., Japan, France, and United Kingdom) have initiated HDR development programs based on the US work. The US effort at present is in the midst of an experiment that will provide critical performance data, enabling industry to make accurate economic evaluations of the technology. While direct management of the project by Los Alamos has resulted in major scientific strides in technology, the lack of industry involvement to date has been a program weakness. The proposed transition of the existing HDR Program to an industry-based technology would alleviate this weakness and more importantly lay the groundwork for initial commercial HDR power production before the year 2000.
Logging Report for Temp./Gamma/CCL Logs of EE-2A, EE-1, and GT-2\1993\Three logs were performed at Fenton Hill during the week of October 11th. All were Temp./Gamma/CCL (Casing-Collar Locator), logs. Each were similar yet presented different procedures and problems due to well conditions, etc. These logs were performed according to the Operations and Safety Plan, that was distributed prior to the logs. This report is written to point out deviations from those procedures, problems encountered during the logging operations, and results of the logs. 
LTFT Seismicity\1993\"From December 24, 1992 to May 6, 1993, 49 seismic events have been recorded by the Precambrian Seismic Network at Fenton Hill that are believed to be reservoir events. Of these 49 events, 31 were locatable having 5 or more pickable phases. The location program used during 2032 was used again but yielded locations with high residuals. The station location file was then updated to reflect new depths of GT-1 and PC-1 and a S-wave station correction was calculated for PC-2 for which none had existed. Using this new station location file greatly reduced the residuals and 25 events of quality ""c"" or better are plotted as figure 1. An event of ""c"" quality is one with a RMS residual of less then l0msec, or 75m. A plot of ""a"" and ""b"" quality' events from 2032 (the MHF) and the ICFT are provided for comparison (figures 2, 3.) "
Magmatic and Thermal Structure of the Crust in the Clear Lake Area: Implications for HDR Development\1993\With conductive thermal gradients ranging from 80-120°Cikm over an area of 750 km2, and the Jack of convectional geothermal reservoirs, the Clear Lake area of California is one of the best prospects for hot dry rock (HDR) geothermal development in the U.S. This talk summarizes what we know about the magmatic system at Clear Lake, and what implications this has for HDR site selection. Emphasis is placed on the distribution of volcanism through time, and the chemical, mineralogical, and textural features of Clear Lake magmatism. The nature of upper crustal magma bodies at Clear Lake is inferred from studying sequences of closely related silicic lava flows. These lavas tell a story of multi-stage mixing of silicic and mafic magma in clusters of small reservoirs. Some mafic to intermediate lavas at Clear Lake also contain crustal xenoliths which provide information about deeper levels of the magmatic system. The xenolith suite includes noritic to gabbroic cumulates as well as high-grade metamorphic rocks. Together, these rocks probably represents fragments of gabbroic intrusions and their contact aureoles. Preliminary thermobarometry on granulites yields temperature and depth estimates of -800-9000C and 1218 km. Metasedimentary xenoliths also exhibit partial melting textures, providing direct evidence for assimilation in the deep crust. The chemical and isotopic signatures of volcanic rocks also confirm that extensive mixing of mantle and crustal components was an important petrogenetic pathway to silicic magmas. 
Possible Reservoir Events at Fenton Hill\1993\Two seismic events were detected by the Fenton Hill Seismic Network that may have come from the reservoir. The first and the larger of the two occurred at 00:03 MST on December 24, 1992. The event was recorded on all three pre-cambrian stations and five usable phases were picked. The event was located at 538 m North, 367 m West at a depth of 3229 m. The residuals were high making this location very uncertain. If this location is correct, it places this event over 300 meters further north than any event located during experiment 2032. The magnitude of this event, based on coda length, was similar to those during 2032. A change in the flow rates of the reservoir occurred at 00:37 MST; 34 minutes after this event. The second event occurred 16:51 MST on January 2, 1993. Though much smaller than the December 24th event, it has very similar character. This event was located 350 m South, 148 m West at a depth of 3645 m. Again, the location was quite uncertain but does fall into the region of seismicity located during 2032. The reservoir was operating at steady flow rates during this time and no change in rates was observed around the time of this event. 
Summary of HDR Technology Commercialization Board Meeting\1993\The Hot Dry Rock Technology Commercialization Board met on April 15, 1993, to review the current status of the Los Alamos Program and suggest future courses of action. During the first part of the meeting, the position of the U. S. DOE was presented, the most recent results of the long-term testing program were reviewed, and an economic study prepared recently for the DOE was described. This was followed by several hours of wide-ranging discussions on the future of HDR. In brief, the DOE, as represented by George Tennyson of the Albuquerque Operations Office, stated that no money would be forthcoming to continue the present long-term test, the 1994 HDR budget would be directed toward putting the Fenton Hill site on standby and seeking industrial partners, and that the development of viable industry support is essential to the continuation of any HDR development effort. Don Brown reported that surface temperature measurements and production well logging had both indicated no thermal drawdown over the flow test period, and water losses had recently reached as low as 7% under stable operating conditions. Bruce Robinson presented tracer data showing that the fluid was following progressively longer pathways through the reservoir as the flow test proceeded. Bruce also described the low levels of solids and gases in the fluid found in geochemical testing. Bob Hendron discussed actual power costs of running the site, showed the quantity of excess energy being produced, and discussed a number of scenarios that could be extrapolated from the hard cost data collected during the flow testing. Finally, Ken Pierce of Sandia Laboratories presented an economic analysis of HDR (formally described as a Technology Assessment) he recently prepared for the DOE. Considerable discussion arose from Ken's presentation centered primarily around the projected drilling costs (believed to be too high) and the capital recovery rate (believed to be way too low). 
The xerolithic geothermal (``hot dry rock``) energy resource of the United States: An update\1993\This report presents revised estimates, based upon the most current geothermal gradient data, of the xerolithic geothermal (``hot dry rock`` or HDR) energy resources of the United States. State-by-state tabular listings are provided of the HDR energy resource base, the accessible resource base, and the potentially useful resource base. The latter further subdivided into components with potential for electricity generation, process heat, and space heat. Comparisons are made with present estimates of fossil fuel reserves. A full-sized geothermal gradient contour map is provided as a supplement in a pocket inside the back cover of the report.
EE-3A Logging Report for April 5th 1994\1994\"A Temperature/Casing-Collar Locator (CCL) log of EE-3A was performed on Tuesday, April 5th., 1994. This log was the second of two, (the first was run on February 28th., 19 94.) , in an attempt to investigate a temperature anomaly occurring between 10,000 to 11,435 ft. The thermal recovery of this zone was slower than expected, which was believed to be caused by either; flow through the cemented zone of the 5 1/2"" liner, or an upward flow through the reservoir itself. After the first log was run, the annulus of EE-3A was shut-in for a period of a little more than one month, at which time the log was repeated. If the temperature of this zone were to show signs of recovery after the shut-in period, the integrity of the cement would have been in question. No sign of recovery would point to upward reservoir flow theory. The zone of interest shows no sign of recovery during the shut-in period Consistency of logging procedures, hardware, etc., was important so that an accurate comparison could be made. In addition, procedures for both logs were modeled from a December 10th, 1993 temperature log, so that a comparison of all three could be used. The December 10th, log of EE-3A was the first temperature log done since the LTFT, and the log that alerted us to the anomaly. "
EE-3A Logging Report for Feb. 28th 1994\1994\"A Temperature/Casing-Collar Locator (CCL) log of EE-3A was performed on Monday, February 28th, 1994. This log was the first of two, (the other to be run on March 31st.), in an attempt to investigate a temperature anomaly occurring between 10,000 to 11,435 ft. The thermal recovery of this zone is slower than expected, which is believed to be caused by either; flow through the cemented zone of the 5 1/2"" liner, or an upward flow through the reservoir itself. Now that the first log is over, the annulus of EE-3A will be shut-in for a period of approximately one month, at which time the log will be repeated. If the temperature of this zone shows signs of recovery after the shut-in period, the integrity of the cement will be in question. No sign of recovery will point to upward reservoir flow theory. Consistency of logging procedures, hardware, etc., is important so that an accurate comparison can be made. In addition, procedures for both logs have been modeled from the December 10th, 1993 log, so that a comparison of all three can be used. The December 10th, log of EE-3A was the first temperature log done since the LTFT, and the log that alerted us to the anomaly. "
How to achieve a four-fold productivity increase at Fenton Hill\1994\The most direct way to increase the productivity of the Fenton Hill HDR reservoir is by drilling a second production well to access the presently unavailable deeper southern portion of the reservoir. This second well, with no other operational changes, should approximately double the reservoir productivity. However, by also allowing a significant increase in the injection pressure level without inducing renewed reservoir growth, this second production well would indirectly provide an additional factor of 2 increase in reservoir productivity. Essentially, this second production well to the south of the existing injection well would establish a pressure sink in this previously static portion of the reservoir, precluding reservoir extension in this region for even higher levels of injection pressure. In this way, the ambient pressure level of the reservoir could be significantly increased, further dilating the joint network comprising the active reservoir flow system and thereby reducing the overall impedance to flow across the reservoir. If the augmented productivity of the present HDR reservoir as a consequence of pressure cycling in May of 1993 is used as the base case, the anticipated thermal power production from a 3-well system at Fenton Hill would be about 20 MW, at a combined production flow rate of 340 gpm and at a production temperature of 204 °C (400 °F).
Logging Report for April 19th and 20th 1994, Temp/CCL Logs of EE-3A\1994\"Two Temperature/Casing-Collar Locator (CCL), logs of EE-3A were performed on April 19th., and 20th., 1994, in an effort to locate fractures where fluid exits the injection wellbore. The first log was run, to serve as background data for comparison to the second log, which was run after a period of injection. The first log was done under static conditions, (with the exceptions of fluid that escaped through the control head during the log, and the continuous venting of the annulus). The log was then repeated the next day, after an approximate six hours of injection, with the Rotojet pump (at a rate of approximately 24 gpm). It was hoped that the short injection period would create anomalies in temperature across fractures, which could be identified by the log. The results however, were less than hoped for. A depth-driven strip chart, recording both load-cell weight, and CCL was run on both logs. Also, it was planed to speed up the logging rate through the zone of 11,700' to 11,790', which was believed to be an area common to premature setdown. After looking at a variety of previously run logs however, it was determined that these set-downs could occur anywhere in the open hole. For this reason we logged the entire open hole, on both logs, at 75 ft., per minute, and experienced no premature set-downs on either log. These logs were originally scheduled for April 12th., and 13th., according to the ""Operations and Safety Plan"", but were postponed one week due to inclement weather. Zero depth was taken at the upper most valve on the tree, (logging valve), 14 ft., above ground level. "

Hot dry rock energy: Hot dry rock geothermal development program. Progress report. Fiscal year 1993\1995\Extended flow testing at the Fenton Hill Hot Dry Rock (HDR) test facility concluded in Fiscal Year 1993 with the completion of Phase 2 of the long-term flow test (LTFT) program. As is reported in detail in this report, the second phase of the LTFT, although only 55 days in duration, confirmed in every way the encouraging test results of the 112-day Phase I LTFT carried out in Fiscal Year 1992. Interim flow testing was conducted early in FY 1993 during the period between the two LTFT segments. In addition, two brief tests involving operation of the reservoir on a cyclic schedule were run at the end of the Phase 2 LTFT. These interim and cyclic tests provided an opportunity to conduct evaluations and field demonstrations of several reservoir engineering concepts that can now be applied to significantly increase the productivity of HDR systems. The Fenton Hill HDR test facility was shut down and brought into standby status during the last part of FY 1993. Unfortunately, the world`s largest, deepest, and most productive HDR reservoir has gone essentially unused since that time.

Progress in making hot dry rock geothermal energy a viable renewable energy resource for America in the 21st century\1996\The geothermal energy in hot dry rock (HDR) is a vast resource found almost everywhere in the world. Research and development work conducted by the Los Alamos National Laboratory at the Fenton Hill test site has taken the technology to extract HDR energy from the conceptual stage through a concrete demonstration such that useful amounts of energy can be routinely produced. Flow testing during 1992-1995 has shown that HDR systems are reliable and resilient. HDR technology has a number of unique characteristics that make it particularly suited to the developing energy needs of the world. These include operational flexibility that can provide energy as needed to rapidly meet peaking or unanticipated power demands and the potential for cogeneration of both energy and clean water. HDR technology has been shown to be practical and versatile. The next logical step in making HDR a viable energy resource is to develop an HDR system that will generate and market power, thereby providing the practical operating and economic data needed to promote the rapid commercial application of this unique energy technology.
